## Analyst's Notes

Analysis by Jim Kelleher, CFA, February 1, 2023

## ARGUS RATING: BUY

- PC weakness; data center strength; caution ahead
- Advanced Micro Devices posted 4022 non-GAAP results that exceeded guidance and consensus estimates. Total revenue was up 16% despite weak client (PC) demand.
- AMD posted a 16% annual decline in non-GAAP EPS for 4022, following 3022 results that included its first negative EPS comp since 2019.
- AMD's client (PC) segment sales in 4022 were half the level of 4021 sales. Worldwide PC unit sales declined 29% in 4022 on top of a 15% decline in 3022
- AMD's cautious 1023 guidance on revenue (down 10% year-over-year) reflects the challenging environment. Demand will likely remain weak into early 2023, although we look for sequential recovery as the year progresses.

## INVESTMENT THESIS

market AMD 4Q22 revenue growth of 16%, while non-GAAP EPS fell 25% down on posted

Gaming-related  sales declined year over year, reflecting both inflationary pressure on discretionary   purchases as well as long-in-the-tooth   gaming consoles   from the major OEMs. Embedded has become $1.25 billion for 2021; that is mainly though not exclusively due to the Xilinx acquisition\_ Data Center grew 42% year-over-year in 4Q and 64% for the year. Now $6 billion annual business, data center is driven by market share gains for AMD's EPYC server CPUs.

AMD's client   (PC) segment   sales in  4Q22 sales For demand will likely remain weak into early 2023, although we look for sequential recovery as the year progresses. AMD's cautious 1Q23 revenue growth and gross margin guidance forecast reflects the challenging environment.

As Intel's recent quarterly releases have made clear, AMD has gained meaningful global market share in CPUs for the data center and client space in the past several years. AMD delivered full-year 2022 revenue growth of 44%, on top of 68% growth in 2021 reflecting

For 4Q22, Advanced Micro Devices reported revenue of $6.0 billion, which was up 16% year-over-year and 1 %   sequentially. Revenue included full contribution from Xilinx. Revenue exceeded the high end of the guidance range of S5.2-$5.8 billion and was nearly half a billion dollars above the consensus estimate down 25% from $0.92 year earlier and up $0.01 sequentially . AMD management does not provide explicit EPS guidance. The Street had projected non-GAAP EPS of $0.67 .

For 4Q22, Data Center revenue of $1.66 billion (30% of total) was up 42% year-over-year  and was up Data Center operating profit of $444 million rose 20% from year earlier; although segment margin tightened to 26.8% in 4Q22 from 31.7% for 4Q21, on mix and higher costs.

Overall, and despite challenges that were growing as the fourth quarter progressed, the CEO called 2022 strong year for AMD. The company transformed the company and accelerated the data center business with new products and the acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando. Data Center and Embedded product sales reached combined $10.6 billion in 2022, up from $3.9 billion in 2021 .

Under the new re-organization following the Xilinx acquisition, Data Center   primarily  includes   EPYC server CPUs, GPUs, data processing units (DPUs) and FPGAs and SoCs that largely came from Xilinx. Data Center   growth in 4Q22 was led by EPYC microprocessor sales, with significant demand growth across cloud customers . to North   American customers more than doubled year over year as hyperscale customers continuing moving their internal workload and external instances to EPYC processors as demand   slowed in worsening macro-environment\_ Despite these challenges, AMD continued expending its pipeline by closing several new wins in 4Q22 with Fortune 500 companies in financial services, technology, energy, aerospace; and other verticals.

- The scatterplot shows how AMD stacks up versus its peers on two key characteristics: long-term growth and value.  In general, companies in the lower left-hand corner are more value-oriented, while those in the upper right-hand corner are more growth-oriented.
- The table builds on the   scatterplot   by displaying more financial information.
- The bar charts on the   right take the analysis two steps further, by broadening the   comparison groups into the sector level and the market as a whole. This tool is designed to help investors  understand how AMD might fit into or modify diversified portfolio.

In   November, AMD introduced its fourth-generation EPYC processor  family, delivering twice the performance with an 80% energy-efficiency boost   compared to prior iterations . Customer response has been positive, though likely tempered by the current environment.

Client includes CPUs, accelerated processing units (APUs) that integrate   microprocessors with graphics   processors, and chipsets desktop and notebook PCs. While demand weakness was most intense in consumer   channels, the entire PC space has slowed dramatically . for

Also for 4Q22, Client revenue of $903 million (16% of total) declined 51% annually and 12%  sequentially . Client   posted an operating loss of $152 million for 4Q22, down from profit of $530 million year earlier; the Client business was also unprofitable in sequentially adjacent 3Q22.

Gaming revenue of $1.64 billion (29% of total) was down 7% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially . Gaming operating of $269 million was down 35% from the year-earlier holiday quarter, while segment margin of 16.2% in 4Q22 declined 23.1% for 4Q21. profit from

Embedded revenue of $1.40 billion (25% of total) rose from $71 million year earlier . Embedded sales were also up 7% sequentially   representing   organic growth, given that Xilinx   fully has contributed since 2Q22\_ Embedded operating profit was $699 million  compared to $18 million year earlier; segment margin was 50.0% in 4Q22 vs. 25.4% for 4Q21.

The   Gaming   segment primarily includes discreet   graphics processing units (GPUs) under the Radeon name with semi-custom SoC products and   development   services. In 4Q22, lower gaming graphics sales more than offset higher semi-custom revenue. Despite the maturity of the major gaming   consoles including Microsoft Xbox and PSS, semi-custom SoC revenue 'remained strong in the holiday quarter Although both console families are relatively late in life, console scarcity beginning in the pandemic and stretching through the chain crisis appears to have resulted in significant pent-up demand that carried into holiday sales. along Sony supply

The   Embedded   segment   includes variety of CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs,   adaptive SoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products. Sales of acquired Xilinx   product families are growing because AMD has brought additional manufacturing scales and marketing resources to these products: Key categories served, including   aerospace-defense; industrial, in the quarter; several   categories achieved record sales . AMD   recently announced   multiple new wins in automotive in areas including ADAS and LiDAR for semi-autonomous driving:

As 2023 underway, AMD looks for strong year despite the PC market. The company looks for a stronger second half than first half, with diversified strength across data center, gaming, and embedded to counter PC weakness until the client bus gets weak

In the year since   closing   Xilinx;   according to the CEO, believes integration has gone extremely well. The company AMD overall is positioned to grow revenue and share in 2023 based on the   strength of its competitive positioning and leadership high-performance and adaptive-computing product portfolios. gain

## EARNINGS &amp; GROWTH ANALYSIS

revenue of $6.0 billion;  which was up 16% year-over-year and 1 %  sequentially . Revenue included full contribution from Xilinx. Revenue exceeded the high end of the guidance range of $5.2-$5.8 billion and was nearly half a billion dollars above the consensus estimate of $5.5 billion.

Non-GAAP gross margin was 51.1% for 4Q22, VS. 49.9% for 3022 and 50.3% a year earlier; gross margins reflected better mix fewer consumer PCs). Non-GAAP   operating margin was gains

For 1Q23, AMD guided for revenue of S5.0-S5.6 billion, which at the $5.3 billion midpoint would be down 10% annually and 5% from 4Q22. is forecast at 50%   for 1Q23, compared with 52.7% year earlier . with other elements of line-item guidance, AMD's 1Q23 guidance is consistent range,  compared to $1.13 year earlier .

We are lowering our 2023 non-GAAP estimate to $3.49 per diluted share from $4.57. We are implementing non-GAAP EPS forecast for 2024 of $5.10 per diluted share.

We our estimates as fluid   and subject to revision, particularly   given the uncertain global economic and demand outlook. Our   five-year non-GAAP annualized EPS   growth rate forecast   remains 15%, among the highest in Argus Technology coverage. regard

## FINANCIAL STRENGTH &amp; DIVIDEND

Our financial strength on AMD is Medium-High. AMD has successfully restructured its debt, which is helping the company to reduce interest costs. The company has swung to net cash position from net debt position; and has stepped up shareholder returns. We note that the acquisition of Xilinx should add net cash of about $2.2 billion (gross cash of $3.7 billion minus all-in debt of S1.5 billion), based on Xilinx's balance sheet as of 12/31/21). rating

Total debt was $2.47 billion as of the end of 2022, reflecting the addition of Xilinx gross debt. Debt was $313 million as of the end of 2021, $330 million as of the end of 2020, S685 million at the end of 2019, and $1.25 billion at year-end 2018.

AMD's cash was $5.91 billion at the end of 2022, reflecting the addition of Xilinx gross cash Cash was $3.61 billion at the end of 2019, and $1.08 billion at year-end 2018

Net cash was $3.45 billion at the end of 2022. Net cash was $3.29 billion at the end of 2021, $1.96 billion at the end of 2020, and $818 million at the end of 2019. Prior to mid-2019, AMD was in a net debt position for multiple years. Net debt was $172 million at year-end 2018 and $210 million at year-end 2017.

In 2022, AMD announced an $8 billion share-repurchase authorization; that is in addition to the $4 billion authorization announced in 2021. Previously, share repurchases were used primarily to offset dilution from stock-based compensation. May was billion in 2022. Cash flow from operations was $3.52 billion in 2021, $1.07 billion in 2020, $493 million in 2019, and $34 million in 2018-

We do not expect AMD to pay a dividend in 2023 or 2024.

notebook PCs, and the outlook for AMD's Radeon GPUs in the PC gaming. We the XLNX deal as logical next step in AMD's journey, one that adds high-growth complementary assets that will accelerate AMD's growth in the cloud data center and high-value-added nontechnology markets. regard

The acquisition of Xilinx for $35 billion carries multiple risks; including potential issues with cultural integration; misreading of end-market   outlooks, and potential end-market cannibalization We believe these risks are worth the TAM opportunities afforded by XLNX. The all-stock nature of the deal also eliminates   the potential for cumbersome debt burden\_ The deal has diluted the share base, but AMD is acquiring  growing and higher-margin assets that should not be dilutive to EPS.

We believe that the company's IP monetization strategyas well as success in EE&amp;SC, could give CEO Su longer leash than was given to prior CEOs. The pandemic has turned around what had been structural  decline in PCs, and AMD appears positioned for market share gains at the expense of Intel, which is wrestling with production issues\_

A main risk for AMD, as for other semiconductor companies, is the possibility of general economic downturn and corresponding  dip in technology hardware sales due to inflation and interest rates. We believe that AMD has the financial strength, market leadership, and growth characteristics to weather this storm and emerge stronger player . We also believe   the percentage of hours worked away from the office will continue to increase. demand for   personal PCs served by AMD CPUs, for data center CPUs to manage fast-growing data tra and for GPUs for gaming applications. rising iffic,

AMD has been   betting   heavily on nontraditional   businesses, including embedded, micro-server, and semi-custom (gaming console) . Simultaneously, AMD is supporting both stand-alone CPU and GPU lines as well as its APU line that combines compute and graphics processing on single die.

## COMPANY DESCRIPTION

Advanced Micro Devices is the number-two player in x86-based microprocessors, behind Intel, and with the 2008 acquisition of ATI top player in graphic processors. In 2021, Advanced Micro Devices acquired   Xilinx, expanding its presence in embedded computing and data center.

## VALUATION

AMD shares are trading at 21.S-times our 2023 non-GAAP EPS estimate and at 14.7-times our 2024 projection . AMD trades at two-year forward PIE of 18.1, compared to multiple of 42.6 for the 2018-2021 period. The two-year-forward relative PlE of 1.05 is just above the market PIE and remains well below the historical average for 2018-2021 of 2.19. Historical comparable  valuation for AMD indicates value in the low $200s, in stable trend and well above current prices \_

While the client market is likely to remain volatile in the near term, we are encouraged by the progress   of EPYC in cloud and enterprise data center, the success of Ryzen CPUs for desktop and

Peer group analysis suggests that AMD deserves to trade at premium to peers on absolute and relative PIE; our peer-indicated value is in the $90s, down from a late 2021 in the $160s due to the 2022 peer-group selloff. Our discounted free cash flow model renders fair value in the $150s, down from past peaks on slowing PC momentum. Blending these approaches, we arrive at value above $150, below past peaks but well above current prices. peak

On February at midday, BUY-rated AMD traded at $80.48, up $5.33.

Like many Technology stocks, AMD has slipped from its highs on consumer demand softness Current prices in our view do not reflect AMD's revenue and margin   growth   potential, and ongoing market share gains at Intel's expense We are reiterating our BUY rating to 12-month target price of $100. fully
