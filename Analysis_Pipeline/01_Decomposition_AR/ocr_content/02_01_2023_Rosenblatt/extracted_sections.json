    "BUY- rated Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NGS: AMD) rose \\(7\\%\\) in a down market on 2/1/23 after the company delivered results that exceeded 4Q22 guidance. AMD posted 4Q22 revenue growth of \\(16\\%\\) , while non- GAAP EPS fell \\(25\\%\\) .",
    "AMD's client (PC) segment sales in 4Q22 were half the level of 4Q21 sales. For context, worldwide PC sales declined \\(29\\%\\) in 4Q22 on top of a \\(15\\%\\) decline in 3Q22. PC demand will likely remain weak into early 2023, although we look for sequential recovery as the year progresses. AMD's cautious 1Q23 revenue growth and gross margin guidance forecast reflects the challenging environment.",
    "Gaming- related sales declined year over year, reflecting both inflationary pressure on discretionary purchases as well as long- in- the- tooth gaming consoles from the major OEMs. Embedded has become a \\(4.5 billion annual business for AMD, compared with\\) 1.25 billion for 2021; that is mainly though not exclusively due to the Xilinx acquisition. Data Center grew \\(42\\%\\) year- over- year in 4Q and \\(64\\%\\) for the year. Now a \\(6 billion annual business, data center is driven by market share gains for AMD's EPYC server CPUs.",
    "As Intel's recent quarterly releases have made clear, AMD has gained meaningful global market share in CPUs for the data center and client space in the past several years. AMD delivered full- year 2022 revenue growth of \\(44\\%\\) , on top of \\(68\\%\\) growth in 2021 reflecting",

  "Analyst's Notes...Continued": [
    "multi- year gains in market share. The early 2023 growth outlook is uncertain. But share gains in client and in data center, market leadership in console gaming, and the much enhanced embedded business position AMD for long- term growth exceeding those of the market and the peer group.",
    "AMD has announced that long- time finance industry professional Jean Hu is joining the company as CFO. She replaces Devinder Kumar, who is retiring. CFO. Hu has served in the CFO role (and at times as interim CEO) at QLogic, Conexant, and Marvell, along with other postings. She is well- respected in financial circles, and we believe she will benefit the already strong leadership team at AMD.",
    "In our view, the share price does not fully reflect AMD's long- term revenue and margin growth potential, along with ongoing market share gains at Intel's expense. We are reiterating our BUY rating and 12- month target price of \\(\\) 100\\$",
    "She is well respected in financial circles, and we believe she will benefit the already strong leadership team at AMD.",
    "Overall, and despite challenges that were growing as the fourth quarter progressed, the CEO called 2022 a strong year for AMD. The company transformed the company and accelerated the data center business with new products and the acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando. Data Center and Embedded product sales reached a combined \\(10.6 billion in 2022, up from\\) 3.9 billion in 2021.",
    "For 4Q22, Data Center revenue of \\(1.66 billion (30\\%\\) of total) was up \\(42\\%\\) year- over- year and was up \\(3\\%\\) sequentially. Data Center operating profit of \\(444 million rose 20\\%\\) from a year earlier, although segment margin tightened to \\(26.8\\%\\) in 4Q22 from \\(31.7\\%\\) for 4Q21, on mix and higher costs.",
    "Under the new re- organization following the Xilinx acquisition, Data Center primarily includes EPYC server CPUs, GPUs, data processing units (DPUs) and FPGAs and SoCs that largely came from Xilinx. Data Center growth in 4Q22 was led by EPYC microprocessor sales, with significant demand growth across cloud customers. Cloud sales to North American customers more than doubled year over year as hyperscale customers continuing moving their internal workload and external instances to EPYC processors.",
    "Also in Data Center, enterprise revenue declined year- over- year as demand slowed in a worsening macro- environment. Despite these challenges, AMD continued expending its pipeline by closing several new wins in 4Q22 with Fortune 500 companies in financial services, technology, energy, aerospace, and other verticals. EPYC",
    "that the company believes is helping mitigate some of the worst of the downdraft. Although overall PC demand remains soft, the CEO noted that 'desktop channel sell- through increased sequentially during the holiday season.' AMD launched its latest- generation Ryzen series notebook processors in January, including the first Ryzen processors to feature AI capabilities. This includes the on- chip AI inference engine built into an x86 processor, in the first integration of AMD and Xilinx intellectual property.",
    "Gaming revenue of \\(\\) 1.64\\(billion (29\\%\\) of total) was down 7% year - over - year and up 1% sequentially. Gaming operating profit of\\) \\ \\(269\\) million was down \\(35\\%\\) from the year- earlier holiday quarter, while segment margin of \\(16.2\\%\\) in 4Q22 declined from \\(23.1\\%\\) for 4Q21.",
    "The Gaming segment primarily includes discreet graphics processing units (GPUs) under the Radeon name along with semi- custom SoC products and development services. In 4Q22, lower gaming graphics sales more than offset higher semi- custom revenue. Despite the maturity of the major gaming consoles including Microsoft Xbox and Sony PS5, semi- custom SoC revenue 'remained strong' in the holiday quarter. Although both console families are relatively late in life, console scarcity beginning in the pandemic and stretching through the supply chain crisis appears to have resulted in significant pent- up demand that carried into holiday sales.",
    "Embedded revenue of \\(\\) 1.40\\(billion (25\\%\\) of total) rose from\\) \\ \\(71\\) million a year earlier. Embedded sales were also up \\(7\\%\\) sequentially representing organic growth, given that Xilinx fully has contributed since 2Q22. Embedded operating profit was \\(\\) 699\\(million compared to\\) \\ \\(18\\) million a year earlier; segment margin was \\(50.0\\%\\) in 4Q22 vs. \\(25.4\\%\\) for 4Q21.",
    "The Embedded segment includes a variety of CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, adaptive SoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products. Sales of acquired Xilinx product families are growing because AMD has brought additional manufacturing scales and marketing resources to these products. Key categories served, including aerospace- defense, industrial, medical, and semiconductor test & measurement, all grew in the quarter; several categories achieved record sales. AMD recently announced multiple new wins in automotive in areas including ADAS and LiDAR for semi- autonomous driving.",
    "In the year since closing Xilinx, according to the CEO, integration has gone extremely well. The company believes AMD overall is positioned to grow revenue and gain share in 2023 based on the strength of its competitive positioning and leadership high- performance and adaptive- computing product portfolios.",
    "As 2023 gets underway, AMD looks for a strong year despite the weak PC market. The company looks for a stronger second half than first half, with diversified strength across data center, gaming, and embedded to counter PC weakness until the client bus",
    "at QLogic, Conexant, and Marvell, along with other postings. She is well- respected in financial circles, and we believe she will benefit the already strong leadership team at AMD. Saeied Moshkelani is SVP and GM of Client Compute Group.",
    "We believe that the company's IP monetization strategy, as well as success in EE&SC, could give CEO Su a longer leash than was given to prior CEOs. The pandemic has turned around what had been structural decline in PCs, and AMD appears positioned for market share gains at the expense of Intel, which is wrestling with production issues.",
    "The acquisition of Xilinx for \\(\\) 35\\(billion carries multiple risks, including potential issues with cultural integration, a misreading of end - market outlooks, and potential end - market cannibalization. We believe these risks are worth the TAM opportunities afforded by XLNX. The all - stock nature of the deal also eliminates the potential for a cumbersome debt burden. The deal has diluted the share base, but AMD is acquiring growing and higher - margin assets that should not be dilutive to EPS.",
    "A main risk for AMD, as for other semiconductor companies, is the possibility of a general economic downturn and a corresponding dip in technology hardware sales due to inflation and rising interest rates. We believe that AMD has the financial strength, market leadership, and growth characteristics to weather this storm and emerge a stronger player. We also believe the percentage of hours worked away from the office will continue to increase. That should drive long- term demand for personal PCs served by AMD CPUs, for data center CPUs to manage fast- growing data traffic, and for GPUs for gaming applications.",
    "AMD has been betting heavily on nontraditional businesses, including embedded, micro- server, and semi- custom (gaming console). Simultaneously, AMD is supporting both stand- alone CPU and GPU lines as well as its APU line that combines compute and graphics processing on a single die."
