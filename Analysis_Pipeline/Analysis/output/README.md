## Purpose

This directory contains the **final output** of the entire pipeline analysis:
- **Actionable insights**: Identifies novel claims not supported by company documents
- **Validation results**: Shows which analyst claims are backed by evidence
- **Coverage metrics**: Quantifies the overlap between analyst reports and company disclosures

## Usage

These files represent the culmination of all pipeline stages:
1. OCR extraction (Decomposition_AR)
2. Sentence classification (Decomposition_AR)
3. KB matching (RAG_and_knowledgebase)
4. LLM evaluation (Evaluation)
5. **Final analysis (Analysis)** ← You are here

Use these reports to:
- Understand what novel information analysts are providing
- Identify potential misstatements or contradictions
- Assess analyst report quality and evidence-based claims
- Calculate the "Delta I" (information delta) of analyst insights
