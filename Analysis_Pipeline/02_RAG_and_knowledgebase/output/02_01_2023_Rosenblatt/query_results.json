          "content": "Turning to our Client segment. Revenue declined 51% year-over-year to $903 million. We continue to ship below PC consumption in the fourth\nquarter as we focused on further reducing downstream inventory. While overall PC demand remains soft, desktop channel sell-through increased\nsequentially during the holiday season. We launched our latest generation Ryzen 7000 series notebook processors earlier in January, including our\nRyzen 7040 CPU series that deliver leadership performance in battery life and are our first processors to feature Ryzen AI, the industry's only dedicated\non-chip AI inference engine in an x86 processor. Ryzen AI is powered by the highly scalable XDNA architecture, which is the first integration of\nAMD and Xilinx IP, less than a year after closing the acquisition.\nWe also launched our Ryzen 7045 series CPUs, our first mobile processor based on a chiplet design that delivers significantly higher performance\nthan the competition in gaming and content creation applications. We have more than 250 ultrathin gaming and commercial notebook design\nwins, spanning our full family of Ryzen 7000 series processors on track to launch this year, an increase of 25% year-over-year with the first notebooks\nplanned to go on sale in February.Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 7% year-over-year to $1.6 billion as lower gaming graphics sales more than offset higher\nsemi-custom revenue. Semi-custom SoC revenue grew year-over-year as demand for game consoles remained strong during the holidays. Gaming\ngraphics revenue declined year-over-year as we further reduced desktop GPU downstream channel inventory. Channel sell-through of our Radeon\nRX GPUs increased sequentially, and we launched our high-end Radeon 7900 series GPUs to strong demand based on the performance of our new\nRDNA 3 architecture and 5-nanometer chiplet design.\nIn January, we announced our first RDNA 3 mobile GPUs that have been selected to power new gaming notebooks from Dell, Alienware, ASUS and\nothers that are on track to begin shipping in the first half of 2023.Looking at our Embedded segment. Revenue increased significantly year-over-year to a record $1.4 billion. We had record sales across a number\nof our Embedded markets, including communications, automotive, industrial and health care, aerospace and defense, and test and emulation. In\ncommunications, we saw particular strength with expanded 5G wireless installations in India and ongoing wired infrastructure deployments with\nTier 1 communications providers. Automotive growth was driven by the ramps of new Ford camera, 4D radar and infotainment wins across multiple\ncustomers. We recently announced multiple new wins for our automotive grade Zynq UltraScale+ platforms with some of the largest vehicleequipment suppliers including Aisin next-generation Automated Parking Assist system and DENSO's next-generation LiDAR platform that can\nimprove the resolution required for autonomous driving and other industrial machine vision applications by 20x.\nWe also continued to see strong growth with industrial and health care, aerospace and defense and tested and emulation customers in the quarter,\ndriven by SAM expansion for our leadership-adaptive SoCs, new design win ramps and increased supply across multiple nodes.\nTaking a step back, as we approach the 1-year anniversary of the closing of our Xilinx acquisition next month, the integration has gone extremely\nwell, and our Embedded business has become a major growth driver for AMD, strengthening our financial model and significantly diversifying our\nbusiness. In addition, we are seeing substantial new revenue synergy opportunities as we combine Xilinx's industry-leading adaptive products and\n6,000-plus customers with AMD's expanded breadth of compute products and scale.In summary, overall, 2022 was a strong year for AMD despite the weak PC market. We significantly grew our Data Center, Embedded and Gaming\nbusinesses and executed well across our product portfolio. As we enter 2023, we expect the overall demand environment to remain mixed with\n4\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com  | Contact Us\n©2023 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

In the PC market, we are planning for the PC TAM to be down approximately 10% for 2023. We expect\nto continue to ship below consumption in the first quarter to reduce downstream inventory, which is reflected in our guidance.\nIn our Embedded and Data Center segments, we believe we are well positioned to grow revenue and gain share in 2023 based on the strength of\nour competitive positioning and leadership high-performance and adaptive product portfolio. We do see elevated levels of inventory with some\ncloud customers, which will lead to a softer first half and a stronger second half of the year. We continue working very closely with our customersto navigate the dynamic market conditions while also making the right strategic investments to exit the current cycle with an even stronger and\nmore differentiated set of products to drive future growth.\nOver the next several years, one of our largest growth opportunities is in AI, which is in the early stages of transforming virtually every industry\nservice and product. We expect AI adoption will accelerate significantly over the coming years and are incredibly excited about leveraging our\nbroad portfolio of CPUs, GPUs and adaptive accelerators in combination with our software expertise to deliver differentiated solutions that can\naddress the full spectrum of AI needs in training and inference across cloud, edge and client.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year financial results. Jean?Jean X. Hu  - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. 2022 was a very strong year for AMD. We had a record revenue, gross margin, profitability, and we\ngenerated significant free cash flow. The year was also highlighted by our strategic acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando, expanding and diversifying\nour business portfolio.\nFourth quarter 2022 revenue for $5.6 billion was up 16% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue in the Embedded and Data Center segment,\npartially offset by lower Client and the Gaming segment revenue. Gross margin was 51%, up 70 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by\nricher product mix with higher revenue in Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. Operatingexpenses were $1.6 billion compared to $1.1 billion a year ago, driven by the inclusion of Xilinx OpEx and additional R&D and go-to-market\ninvestments to support the next phase of our revenue growth.\nOperating income declined $66 million from a year ago to $1.3 billion, and the operating margin was 23%, down from 27% a year ago. Net income\nwas $1.1 billion flat year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.92 per share a year ago, primarily due to lower client\noperating income.\nNow turning to our reportable segment for the fourth quarter. Starting with the Data Center segment. Revenue was $1.7 billion, up 42% year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by strong growth in third-generation EPYC server processor revenue and the early ramp of fourth-generation EPYC processors.Data center operating income was $444 million or 27% of revenue compared to $369 million or 32% a year ago. Higher operating income was\ndriven primarily by stronger revenue, partially offset by higher R&D investment to support the top line revenue growth.\nClient segment revenue was $903 million, down 51% year-over-year due to reduced processor shipments resulting from a weak PC market and\nsignificant inventory correction across the PC supply chain. Client operating loss was $152 million compared to operating income of $530 million\na year ago or 29% of revenue, primarily due to lower revenue.\nGaming segment revenue was $1.6 billion, down 7% year-over-year due to lower gaming graphics revenue, partially offset by higher semi-customerproduct sales. Gaming operating income was $266 million or 16% of revenue compared to $407 million or 23% a year ago. The decrease was\nprimarily due to lower graphics revenue.\nEmbedded segment revenue was $1.4 billion, up $1.3 billion from a year ago, primarily due to the inclusion of Xilinx Embedded revenue. Embedded\noperating income was $699 million or 50% of revenue compared to $18 million or 25% a year ago, primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx.\n5\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com  | Contact Us\n©2023 Refinitiv.

We have a strong balance sheet with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment of $5.9 billion at the end of\nthe fourth quarter. During the quarter, we returned $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases. In 2022, we returned a total of $3.7\nbillion to shareholders which was 119% of free cash flow. We have $6.5 billion in remaining authorization to share repurchases. Free cash flow was\n$443 million compared to $736 million in the same quarter last year.\nFree cash flow decreased primarily due to higher inventory. Inventory was $3.8 billion, up approximately $402 million from the prior quarter,\nprimarily driven by the inventory increase in advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products.Now let me turn to our full year financial results. 2022 revenue was $23.6 billion, up 44% year-over-year, driven by increased Embedded, Data\nCenter and the Gaming segment revenue, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. On our combined AMD and Xilinx company basis, 2022\npro forma revenue was $24.1 billion, up 20% compared to $20.1 billion in 2021. Gross margin was 52%, up 370 basis points from the prior year,\nprimarily driven by richer product mix with higher revenue from Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment\nrevenue.\nOperating expenses were 26% of revenue compared to 24% in 2021. 2022 operating income was $6.3 billion, up $2.3 billion, an increase of 56%\nfrom a year ago resulting in operating margin of 27% compared to 25% in 2021, primarily driven by higher revenue and gross margin expansion.\nNet income was $5.5 billion compared to $3.4 billion, up 60% from the prior year. Earnings per share was $3.50 compared to $2.79 for the prior\nyear, primarily due to Data Center growth and addition of Xilinx.\nFull year free cash flow was $3.1 billion, resulting free cash flow margin of 13% for the year. We invested approximately $1 billion in long-term\nsupply chain capacity in 2022 to support our expectations for future revenue growth and increase market share.",

          "content": "Looking at our Embedded segment. Revenue increased significantly year-over-year to a record $1.4 billion. We had record sales across a number\nof our Embedded markets, including communications, automotive, industrial and health care, aerospace and defense, and test and emulation. In\ncommunications, we saw particular strength with expanded 5G wireless installations in India and ongoing wired infrastructure deployments with\nTier 1 communications providers. Automotive growth was driven by the ramps of new Ford camera, 4D radar and infotainment wins across multiple\ncustomers. We recently announced multiple new wins for our automotive grade Zynq UltraScale+ platforms with some of the largest vehicleequipment suppliers including Aisin next-generation Automated Parking Assist system and DENSO's next-generation LiDAR platform that can\nimprove the resolution required for autonomous driving and other industrial machine vision applications by 20x.\nWe also continued to see strong growth with industrial and health care, aerospace and defense and tested and emulation customers in the quarter,\ndriven by SAM expansion for our leadership-adaptive SoCs, new design win ramps and increased supply across multiple nodes.\nTaking a step back, as we approach the 1-year anniversary of the closing of our Xilinx acquisition next month, the integration has gone extremely\nwell, and our Embedded business has become a major growth driver for AMD, strengthening our financial model and significantly diversifying our\nbusiness. In addition, we are seeing substantial new revenue synergy opportunities as we combine Xilinx's industry-leading adaptive products and\n6,000-plus customers with AMD's expanded breadth of compute products and scale.In summary, overall, 2022 was a strong year for AMD despite the weak PC market. We significantly grew our Data Center, Embedded and Gaming\nbusinesses and executed well across our product portfolio. As we enter 2023, we expect the overall demand environment to remain mixed with\n4\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com  | Contact Us\n©2023 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

In the PC market, we are planning for the PC TAM to be down approximately 10% for 2023. We expect\nto continue to ship below consumption in the first quarter to reduce downstream inventory, which is reflected in our guidance.\nIn our Embedded and Data Center segments, we believe we are well positioned to grow revenue and gain share in 2023 based on the strength of\nour competitive positioning and leadership high-performance and adaptive product portfolio. We do see elevated levels of inventory with some\ncloud customers, which will lead to a softer first half and a stronger second half of the year. We continue working very closely with our customersto navigate the dynamic market conditions while also making the right strategic investments to exit the current cycle with an even stronger and\nmore differentiated set of products to drive future growth.\nOver the next several years, one of our largest growth opportunities is in AI, which is in the early stages of transforming virtually every industry\nservice and product. We expect AI adoption will accelerate significantly over the coming years and are incredibly excited about leveraging our\nbroad portfolio of CPUs, GPUs and adaptive accelerators in combination with our software expertise to deliver differentiated solutions that can\naddress the full spectrum of AI needs in training and inference across cloud, edge and client.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year financial results. Jean?Jean X. Hu  - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. 2022 was a very strong year for AMD. We had a record revenue, gross margin, profitability, and we\ngenerated significant free cash flow. The year was also highlighted by our strategic acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando, expanding and diversifying\nour business portfolio.\nFourth quarter 2022 revenue for $5.6 billion was up 16% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue in the Embedded and Data Center segment,\npartially offset by lower Client and the Gaming segment revenue. Gross margin was 51%, up 70 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by\nricher product mix with higher revenue in Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. Operatingexpenses were $1.6 billion compared to $1.1 billion a year ago, driven by the inclusion of Xilinx OpEx and additional R&D and go-to-market\ninvestments to support the next phase of our revenue growth.\nOperating income declined $66 million from a year ago to $1.3 billion, and the operating margin was 23%, down from 27% a year ago. Net income\nwas $1.1 billion flat year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.92 per share a year ago, primarily due to lower client\noperating income.\nNow turning to our reportable segment for the fourth quarter. Starting with the Data Center segment. Revenue was $1.7 billion, up 42% year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by strong growth in third-generation EPYC server processor revenue and the early ramp of fourth-generation EPYC processors.Data center operating income was $444 million or 27% of revenue compared to $369 million or 32% a year ago. Higher operating income was\ndriven primarily by stronger revenue, partially offset by higher R&D investment to support the top line revenue growth.\nClient segment revenue was $903 million, down 51% year-over-year due to reduced processor shipments resulting from a weak PC market and\nsignificant inventory correction across the PC supply chain. Client operating loss was $152 million compared to operating income of $530 million\na year ago or 29% of revenue, primarily due to lower revenue.\nGaming segment revenue was $1.6 billion, down 7% year-over-year due to lower gaming graphics revenue, partially offset by higher semi-customerproduct sales. Gaming operating income was $266 million or 16% of revenue compared to $407 million or 23% a year ago. The decrease was\nprimarily due to lower graphics revenue.\nEmbedded segment revenue was $1.4 billion, up $1.3 billion from a year ago, primarily due to the inclusion of Xilinx Embedded revenue. Embedded\noperating income was $699 million or 50% of revenue compared to $18 million or 25% a year ago, primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx.\n5\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com  | Contact Us\n©2023 Refinitiv.

We have a strong balance sheet with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment of $5.9 billion at the end of\nthe fourth quarter. During the quarter, we returned $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases. In 2022, we returned a total of $3.7\nbillion to shareholders which was 119% of free cash flow. We have $6.5 billion in remaining authorization to share repurchases. Free cash flow was\n$443 million compared to $736 million in the same quarter last year.\nFree cash flow decreased primarily due to higher inventory. Inventory was $3.8 billion, up approximately $402 million from the prior quarter,\nprimarily driven by the inventory increase in advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products.Now let me turn to our full year financial results. 2022 revenue was $23.6 billion, up 44% year-over-year, driven by increased Embedded, Data\nCenter and the Gaming segment revenue, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. On our combined AMD and Xilinx company basis, 2022\npro forma revenue was $24.1 billion, up 20% compared to $20.1 billion in 2021. Gross margin was 52%, up 370 basis points from the prior year,\nprimarily driven by richer product mix with higher revenue from Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment\nrevenue.\nOperating expenses were 26% of revenue compared to 24% in 2021. 2022 operating income was $6.3 billion, up $2.3 billion, an increase of 56%\nfrom a year ago resulting in operating margin of 27% compared to 25% in 2021, primarily driven by higher revenue and gross margin expansion.\nNet income was $5.5 billion compared to $3.4 billion, up 60% from the prior year. Earnings per share was $3.50 compared to $2.79 for the prior\nyear, primarily due to Data Center growth and addition of Xilinx.\nFull year free cash flow was $3.1 billion, resulting free cash flow margin of 13% for the year. We invested approximately $1 billion in long-term\nsupply chain capacity in 2022 to support our expectations for future revenue growth and increase market share.Let me now turn to our financial outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current macro environment. For\nthe first quarter of 2023, we expect revenue to be approximately $5.3 billion, plus or minus $300 million, a decrease of approximately 10%\nyear-over-year and 5% sequentially. Year-over-year Data Center and Embedded segment revenue are expected to grow, offset by lower Client and\nGaming segment revenue. Sequentially, Embedded segment revenue is expected to increase. Client and Gaming segment revenue are expected\nto decline largely consistent with seasonality. Data Center segment revenue is expected to decline due to elevated levels of inventory with some\ncloud customers.In addition, for Q1 2023, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 50%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.6\nbillion; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $146 million based on a 13% effective tax rate. Diluted share count is\nexpected to be approximately 1.62 billion shares. For the full year of 2023, we are not providing specific guidance due to the uncertainty in the\nmacro environment. However, let me provide some color.\nDirectionally, we expect Embedded and Data Center annual revenue to grow from 2022 based on the strength of our product portfolio and expected\nshare gains. In addition, we expect Client and the Gaming segment revenue to decline based on the current demand environment. We expectnon-GAAP gross margin to be approximately flattish in the first half and the expansion in the second half of the year. We expect to manage quarterly\nnon-GAAP operating expenses flat with the fourth quarter until we see the demand environment improves. For modeling purpose, we expect\nnon-GAAP effective tax rate for the year to be 13% and the diluted share count to be approximately 1.62 billion shares.\nIn closing, we had a strong year with record revenue and profitability, driven by our leadership in product portfolio and the diversification of our\nbusiness. Looking forward to 2023, as Lisa mentioned earlier, we'll continue to focus on executing our long-term growth strategy while driving",

See Cautionary Statement on\nSlide 2. These forward-looking outlook statements and non-GAAP measures are based on current expectations as of January 31, 2023, and assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks anduncertainties. AMD undertakes no intent or obligation to publicly update or revise its outlook statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\nAll items, except revenue, are on a non-GAAP basis. Adjustments to arrive at the GAAP financial outlook typically include stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, income\ntax provision, equity income in investee, and other non- recurring items such as loss on debt redemption/conversion, impairment charges and acquisition-related costs. The timing and impact of such\nadjustments are dependent on future events that are typically uncertain or outside of AMD's control, therefore, a reconciliation to equivalent GAAP measures is not practicable at this time. 2.

          "content": "Looking at our Embedded segment. Revenue increased significantly year-over-year to a record $1.4 billion. We had record sales across a number\nof our Embedded markets, including communications, automotive, industrial and health care, aerospace and defense, and test and emulation. In\ncommunications, we saw particular strength with expanded 5G wireless installations in India and ongoing wired infrastructure deployments with\nTier 1 communications providers. Automotive growth was driven by the ramps of new Ford camera, 4D radar and infotainment wins across multiple\ncustomers. We recently announced multiple new wins for our automotive grade Zynq UltraScale+ platforms with some of the largest vehicleequipment suppliers including Aisin next-generation Automated Parking Assist system and DENSO's next-generation LiDAR platform that can\nimprove the resolution required for autonomous driving and other industrial machine vision applications by 20x.\nWe also continued to see strong growth with industrial and health care, aerospace and defense and tested and emulation customers in the quarter,\ndriven by SAM expansion for our leadership-adaptive SoCs, new design win ramps and increased supply across multiple nodes.\nTaking a step back, as we approach the 1-year anniversary of the closing of our Xilinx acquisition next month, the integration has gone extremely\nwell, and our Embedded business has become a major growth driver for AMD, strengthening our financial model and significantly diversifying our\nbusiness. In addition, we are seeing substantial new revenue synergy opportunities as we combine Xilinx's industry-leading adaptive products and\n6,000-plus customers with AMD's expanded breadth of compute products and scale.In summary, overall, 2022 was a strong year for AMD despite the weak PC market. We significantly grew our Data Center, Embedded and Gaming\nbusinesses and executed well across our product portfolio. As we enter 2023, we expect the overall demand environment to remain mixed with\n4\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com  | Contact Us\n©2023 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

In the PC market, we are planning for the PC TAM to be down approximately 10% for 2023. We expect\nto continue to ship below consumption in the first quarter to reduce downstream inventory, which is reflected in our guidance.\nIn our Embedded and Data Center segments, we believe we are well positioned to grow revenue and gain share in 2023 based on the strength of\nour competitive positioning and leadership high-performance and adaptive product portfolio. We do see elevated levels of inventory with some\ncloud customers, which will lead to a softer first half and a stronger second half of the year. We continue working very closely with our customersto navigate the dynamic market conditions while also making the right strategic investments to exit the current cycle with an even stronger and\nmore differentiated set of products to drive future growth.\nOver the next several years, one of our largest growth opportunities is in AI, which is in the early stages of transforming virtually every industry\nservice and product. We expect AI adoption will accelerate significantly over the coming years and are incredibly excited about leveraging our\nbroad portfolio of CPUs, GPUs and adaptive accelerators in combination with our software expertise to deliver differentiated solutions that can\naddress the full spectrum of AI needs in training and inference across cloud, edge and client.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year financial results. Jean?Jean X. Hu  - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. 2022 was a very strong year for AMD. We had a record revenue, gross margin, profitability, and we\ngenerated significant free cash flow. The year was also highlighted by our strategic acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando, expanding and diversifying\nour business portfolio.\nFourth quarter 2022 revenue for $5.6 billion was up 16% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue in the Embedded and Data Center segment,\npartially offset by lower Client and the Gaming segment revenue. Gross margin was 51%, up 70 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by\nricher product mix with higher revenue in Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. Operatingexpenses were $1.6 billion compared to $1.1 billion a year ago, driven by the inclusion of Xilinx OpEx and additional R&D and go-to-market\ninvestments to support the next phase of our revenue growth.\nOperating income declined $66 million from a year ago to $1.3 billion, and the operating margin was 23%, down from 27% a year ago. Net income\nwas $1.1 billion flat year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.92 per share a year ago, primarily due to lower client\noperating income.\nNow turning to our reportable segment for the fourth quarter. Starting with the Data Center segment. Revenue was $1.7 billion, up 42% year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by strong growth in third-generation EPYC server processor revenue and the early ramp of fourth-generation EPYC processors.Data center operating income was $444 million or 27% of revenue compared to $369 million or 32% a year ago. Higher operating income was\ndriven primarily by stronger revenue, partially offset by higher R&D investment to support the top line revenue growth.\nClient segment revenue was $903 million, down 51% year-over-year due to reduced processor shipments resulting from a weak PC market and\nsignificant inventory correction across the PC supply chain. Client operating loss was $152 million compared to operating income of $530 million\na year ago or 29% of revenue, primarily due to lower revenue.\nGaming segment revenue was $1.6 billion, down 7% year-over-year due to lower gaming graphics revenue, partially offset by higher semi-customerproduct sales. Gaming operating income was $266 million or 16% of revenue compared to $407 million or 23% a year ago. The decrease was\nprimarily due to lower graphics revenue.\nEmbedded segment revenue was $1.4 billion, up $1.3 billion from a year ago, primarily due to the inclusion of Xilinx Embedded revenue. Embedded\noperating income was $699 million or 50% of revenue compared to $18 million or 25% a year ago, primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx.\n5\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com  | Contact Us\n©2023 Refinitiv.

We have a strong balance sheet with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment of $5.9 billion at the end of\nthe fourth quarter. During the quarter, we returned $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases. In 2022, we returned a total of $3.7\nbillion to shareholders which was 119% of free cash flow. We have $6.5 billion in remaining authorization to share repurchases. Free cash flow was\n$443 million compared to $736 million in the same quarter last year.\nFree cash flow decreased primarily due to higher inventory. Inventory was $3.8 billion, up approximately $402 million from the prior quarter,\nprimarily driven by the inventory increase in advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products.Now let me turn to our full year financial results. 2022 revenue was $23.6 billion, up 44% year-over-year, driven by increased Embedded, Data\nCenter and the Gaming segment revenue, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. On our combined AMD and Xilinx company basis, 2022\npro forma revenue was $24.1 billion, up 20% compared to $20.1 billion in 2021. Gross margin was 52%, up 370 basis points from the prior year,\nprimarily driven by richer product mix with higher revenue from Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment\nrevenue.\nOperating expenses were 26% of revenue compared to 24% in 2021. 2022 operating income was $6.3 billion, up $2.3 billion, an increase of 56%\nfrom a year ago resulting in operating margin of 27% compared to 25% in 2021, primarily driven by higher revenue and gross margin expansion.\nNet income was $5.5 billion compared to $3.4 billion, up 60% from the prior year. Earnings per share was $3.50 compared to $2.79 for the prior\nyear, primarily due to Data Center growth and addition of Xilinx.\nFull year free cash flow was $3.1 billion, resulting free cash flow margin of 13% for the year. We invested approximately $1 billion in long-term\nsupply chain capacity in 2022 to support our expectations for future revenue growth and increase market share.Let me now turn to our financial outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current macro environment. For\nthe first quarter of 2023, we expect revenue to be approximately $5.3 billion, plus or minus $300 million, a decrease of approximately 10%\nyear-over-year and 5% sequentially. Year-over-year Data Center and Embedded segment revenue are expected to grow, offset by lower Client and\nGaming segment revenue. Sequentially, Embedded segment revenue is expected to increase. Client and Gaming segment revenue are expected\nto decline largely consistent with seasonality. Data Center segment revenue is expected to decline due to elevated levels of inventory with some\ncloud customers.In addition, for Q1 2023, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 50%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.6\nbillion; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $146 million based on a 13% effective tax rate. Diluted share count is\nexpected to be approximately 1.62 billion shares. For the full year of 2023, we are not providing specific guidance due to the uncertainty in the\nmacro environment. However, let me provide some color.\nDirectionally, we expect Embedded and Data Center annual revenue to grow from 2022 based on the strength of our product portfolio and expected\nshare gains. In addition, we expect Client and the Gaming segment revenue to decline based on the current demand environment. We expect",

Adjustments to arrive at the GAAP financial outlook typically include stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, income\ntax provision, equity income in investee, and other non- recurring items such as loss on debt redemption/conversion, impairment charges and acquisition-related costs. The timing and impact of such\nadjustments are dependent on future events that are typically uncertain or outside of AMD's control, therefore, a reconciliation to equivalent GAAP measures is not practicable at this time. 2.

Fourth quarter revenue increased 16% year-over-year to $5.6 billion, driven by significant growth in our Embedded\nand Data Center segments, which accounted for more than 50% of overall revenue in the quarter. On a full year basis, we grew annual revenue\n44% to $23.6 billion. We set annual records for revenue, gross margin and profitability driven largely by a 64% increase in our Data Center segment\nrevenue and the strong performance of our Embedded segment following our Xilinx acquisition.Turning to the fourth quarter business results, starting with our Data Center segment. Revenue increased 42% year-over-year to $1.7 billion, led\nby increased adoption of our EPYC processors by cloud providers. In cloud, sales to North American hyperscalers more than doubled year-over-year\nas hyperscale customers continued moving more of their internal workloads and external instances to EPYC processors. EPYC processors now\npower more than 600 publicly available instances globally following the launches of new AMD-based instances from AWS, Microsoft and others\nin the quarter.\nIn Enterprise, revenue declined year-over-year as demand slowed based on the macro environment. Against this backdrop, we continue expandingour pipeline and closed a number of new wins in the fourth quarter with Fortune 500 financial services, automotive, technology, energy and\naerospace companies. In HPC, growing EPYC processor adoption was highlighted by the number of AMD-powered supercomputers on the latest\ntop 500 list increasing by 38% year-over-year. AMD now powers more than 100 of the world's fastest supercomputers and 15 of the top 20 most\nenergy-efficient supercomputers in the world.\nTo build our Data Center leadership, we launched our fourth gen EPYC processors this past November that deliver up to 2x faster performance in\ncloud, enterprise and HPC applications, and are up to 80% more energy efficient than the competition's most recently announced offerings. Weare seeing very strong customer pull for fourth-gen EPYC CPUs, which complement our third-gen offerings with additional performance and\ncapabilities.\nInitial cloud deployments are going very well, and we expect to ramp both internal workloads and public instances throughout 2023.\nFor Enterprise, there are more than 140 fourth-gen EPYC platforms in development from HPE, Dell, Lenovo, Supermicro and others, an increase of\n40% compared to the prior generation.\nNow looking at our broader Data Center portfolio. We had record sales of our Xilinx Data Center and networking products in the quarter, led by\nstrong demand from financial services companies for our newly launched Alveo X3 series boards, optimized for low latency trading.

Joe, we view that the opportunity -- so first of all, I would say that in general, the PC market share numbers are probably a bit noisy right now,\njust given all of the sell-in, sell-through and the inventory dynamics that are being worked through. Actually, in the fourth quarter, we believe we\ngained a little bit of share in the PC market. As we go forward into 2023, we think our product portfolio is very strong. As we look at Ryzen 7000\nand where it goes and where we are positioned in the commercial as well as the high-end consumer segments, we're not changing our strategy\non PCs. Quite -- a few years ago, we really focused on sort of the more premium segments. We have less penetration in the low end, which I think\nis helpful. And as we go forward, we're continuing to focus on commercial PCs and getting a larger footprint in there.\nI will say the enterprise work that we're doing on the server side, I think, links very well to the commercial PC work, and we're continuing to invest\nin sort of the sales and marketing resources to ramp that side of the business.\nJoseph Lawrence Moore  - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director",

On our combined AMD and Xilinx company basis, 2022\npro forma revenue was $24.1 billion, up 20% compared to $20.1 billion in 2021. Gross margin was 52%, up 370 basis points from the prior year,\nprimarily driven by richer product mix with higher revenue from Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment\nrevenue.\nOperating expenses were 26% of revenue compared to 24% in 2021. 2022 operating income was $6.3 billion, up $2.3 billion, an increase of 56%\nfrom a year ago resulting in operating margin of 27% compared to 25% in 2021, primarily driven by higher revenue and gross margin expansion.\nNet income was $5.5 billion compared to $3.4 billion, up 60% from the prior year. Earnings per share was $3.50 compared to $2.79 for the prior\nyear, primarily due to Data Center growth and addition of Xilinx.\nFull year free cash flow was $3.1 billion, resulting free cash flow margin of 13% for the year. We invested approximately $1 billion in long-term\nsupply chain capacity in 2022 to support our expectations for future revenue growth and increase market share.Let me now turn to our financial outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current macro environment. For\nthe first quarter of 2023, we expect revenue to be approximately $5.3 billion, plus or minus $300 million, a decrease of approximately 10%\nyear-over-year and 5% sequentially. Year-over-year Data Center and Embedded segment revenue are expected to grow, offset by lower Client and\nGaming segment revenue. Sequentially, Embedded segment revenue is expected to increase. Client and Gaming segment revenue are expected\nto decline largely consistent with seasonality. Data Center segment revenue is expected to decline due to elevated levels of inventory with some\ncloud customers.In addition, for Q1 2023, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 50%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.6\nbillion; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $146 million based on a 13% effective tax rate. Diluted share count is\nexpected to be approximately 1.62 billion shares. For the full year of 2023, we are not providing specific guidance due to the uncertainty in the\nmacro environment. However, let me provide some color.\nDirectionally, we expect Embedded and Data Center annual revenue to grow from 2022 based on the strength of our product portfolio and expected\nshare gains. In addition, we expect Client and the Gaming segment revenue to decline based on the current demand environment. We expectnon-GAAP gross margin to be approximately flattish in the first half and the expansion in the second half of the year. We expect to manage quarterly\nnon-GAAP operating expenses flat with the fourth quarter until we see the demand environment improves. For modeling purpose, we expect\nnon-GAAP effective tax rate for the year to be 13% and the diluted share count to be approximately 1.62 billion shares.\nIn closing, we had a strong year with record revenue and profitability, driven by our leadership in product portfolio and the diversification of our\nbusiness.

In the PC market, we are planning for the PC TAM to be down approximately 10% for 2023.

We do see elevated levels of inventory with some\ncloud customers, which will lead to a softer first half and a stronger second half of the year.

Jean?Jean X. Hu  - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. 2022 was a very strong year for AMD. We had a record revenue, gross margin, profitability, and we\ngenerated significant free cash flow. The year was also highlighted by our strategic acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando, expanding and diversifying\nour business portfolio.\nFourth quarter 2022 revenue for $5.6 billion was up 16% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue in the Embedded and Data Center segment,\npartially offset by lower Client and the Gaming segment revenue. Gross margin was 51%, up 70 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by\nricher product mix with higher revenue in Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. Operatingexpenses were $1.6 billion compared to $1.1 billion a year ago, driven by the inclusion of Xilinx OpEx and additional R&D and go-to-market\ninvestments to support the next phase of our revenue growth.\nOperating income declined $66 million from a year ago to $1.3 billion, and the operating margin was 23%, down from 27% a year ago. Net income\nwas $1.1 billion flat year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.92 per share a year ago, primarily due to lower client\noperating income.\nNow turning to our reportable segment for the fourth quarter. Starting with the Data Center segment. Revenue was $1.7 billion, up 42% year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by strong growth in third-generation EPYC server processor revenue and the early ramp of fourth-generation EPYC processors.Data center operating income was $444 million or 27% of revenue compared to $369 million or 32% a year ago. Higher operating income was\ndriven primarily by stronger revenue, partially offset by higher R&D investment to support the top line revenue growth.\nClient segment revenue was $903 million, down 51% year-over-year due to reduced processor shipments resulting from a weak PC market and\nsignificant inventory correction across the PC supply chain. Client operating loss was $152 million compared to operating income of $530 million\na year ago or 29% of revenue, primarily due to lower revenue.\nGaming segment revenue was $1.6 billion, down 7% year-over-year due to lower gaming graphics revenue, partially offset by higher semi-customerproduct sales. Gaming operating income was $266 million or 16% of revenue compared to $407 million or 23% a year ago. The decrease was\nprimarily due to lower graphics revenue.\nEmbedded segment revenue was $1.4 billion, up $1.3 billion from a year ago, primarily due to the inclusion of Xilinx Embedded revenue. Embedded\noperating income was $699 million or 50% of revenue compared to $18 million or 25% a year ago, primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx.\n5\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com  | Contact Us\n©2023 Refinitiv.

We have a strong balance sheet with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment of $5.9 billion at the end of\nthe fourth quarter. During the quarter, we returned $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases. In 2022, we returned a total of $3.7\nbillion to shareholders which was 119% of free cash flow. We have $6.5 billion in remaining authorization to share repurchases. Free cash flow was\n$443 million compared to $736 million in the same quarter last year.\nFree cash flow decreased primarily due to higher inventory. Inventory was $3.8 billion, up approximately $402 million from the prior quarter,\nprimarily driven by the inventory increase in advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products.Now let me turn to our full year financial results. 2022 revenue was $23.6 billion, up 44% year-over-year, driven by increased Embedded, Data\nCenter and the Gaming segment revenue, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue.

Fourth quarter revenue increased 16% year-over-year to $5.6 billion, driven by significant growth in our Embedded\nand Data Center segments, which accounted for more than 50% of overall revenue in the quarter. On a full year basis, we grew annual revenue\n44% to $23.6 billion. We set annual records for revenue, gross margin and profitability driven largely by a 64% increase in our Data Center segment\nrevenue and the strong performance of our Embedded segment following our Xilinx acquisition.Turning to the fourth quarter business results, starting with our Data Center segment. Revenue increased 42% year-over-year to $1.7 billion, led\nby increased adoption of our EPYC processors by cloud providers. In cloud, sales to North American hyperscalers more than doubled year-over-year\nas hyperscale customers continued moving more of their internal workloads and external instances to EPYC processors. EPYC processors now\npower more than 600 publicly available instances globally following the launches of new AMD-based instances from AWS, Microsoft and others\nin the quarter.\nIn Enterprise, revenue declined year-over-year as demand slowed based on the macro environment. Against this backdrop, we continue expandingour pipeline and closed a number of new wins in the fourth quarter with Fortune 500 financial services, automotive, technology, energy and\naerospace companies. In HPC, growing EPYC processor adoption was highlighted by the number of AMD-powered supercomputers on the latest\ntop 500 list increasing by 38% year-over-year. AMD now powers more than 100 of the world's fastest supercomputers and 15 of the top 20 most\nenergy-efficient supercomputers in the world.\nTo build our Data Center leadership, we launched our fourth gen EPYC processors this past November that deliver up to 2x faster performance in\ncloud, enterprise and HPC applications, and are up to 80% more energy efficient than the competition's most recently announced offerings. Weare seeing very strong customer pull for fourth-gen EPYC CPUs, which complement our third-gen offerings with additional performance and\ncapabilities.\nInitial cloud deployments are going very well, and we expect to ramp both internal workloads and public instances throughout 2023.\nFor Enterprise, there are more than 140 fourth-gen EPYC platforms in development from HPE, Dell, Lenovo, Supermicro and others, an increase of\n40% compared to the prior generation.\nNow looking at our broader Data Center portfolio. We had record sales of our Xilinx Data Center and networking products in the quarter, led by\nstrong demand from financial services companies for our newly launched Alveo X3 series boards, optimized for low latency trading. Sales of ourPensando DPUs also ramped significantly from the prior quarter, driven by supply chain improvements and continued demand.

          "content": "I also want to welcome our new EVP and CFO, Jean Hu, to our first AMD earnings call since joining us earlier this month. Jean's more than 14 years\nof public company CFO experience and proven track record of financial leadership make her an excellent addition to our team. I look forward to\nworking closely with her as we continue to transform and scale our business.\nNow turning to the business results. 2022 was a strong year for AMD as we navigated the challenging macro environment to deliver best-in-class\ngrowth and record profitability driven by our Embedded and Data Center segments. We also transformed the company. We accelerated our Data\nCenter business and closed our strategic acquisition of Xilinx and Pensando, significantly diversifying our business and strengthening our financialmodel as our Data Center, Embedded product sales grew from $3.9 billion in 2021 to $10.6 billion in 2022.\nLooking at our financial results. Fourth quarter revenue increased 16% year-over-year to $5.6 billion, driven by significant growth in our Embedded\nand Data Center segments, which accounted for more than 50% of overall revenue in the quarter. On a full year basis, we grew annual revenue\n44% to $23.6 billion. We set annual records for revenue, gross margin and profitability driven largely by a 64% increase in our Data Center segment\nrevenue and the strong performance of our Embedded segment following our Xilinx acquisition.Turning to the fourth quarter business results, starting with our Data Center segment. Revenue increased 42% year-over-year to $1.7 billion, led\nby increased adoption of our EPYC processors by cloud providers. In cloud, sales to North American hyperscalers more than doubled year-over-year\nas hyperscale customers continued moving more of their internal workloads and external instances to EPYC processors. EPYC processors now\npower more than 600 publicly available instances globally following the launches of new AMD-based instances from AWS, Microsoft and others\nin the quarter.\nIn Enterprise, revenue declined year-over-year as demand slowed based on the macro environment. Against this backdrop, we continue expandingour pipeline and closed a number of new wins in the fourth quarter with Fortune 500 financial services, automotive, technology, energy and\naerospace companies. In HPC, growing EPYC processor adoption was highlighted by the number of AMD-powered supercomputers on the latest\ntop 500 list increasing by 38% year-over-year. AMD now powers more than 100 of the world's fastest supercomputers and 15 of the top 20 most\nenergy-efficient supercomputers in the world.\nTo build our Data Center leadership, we launched our fourth gen EPYC processors this past November that deliver up to 2x faster performance in\ncloud, enterprise and HPC applications, and are up to 80% more energy efficient than the competition's most recently announced offerings. Weare seeing very strong customer pull for fourth-gen EPYC CPUs, which complement our third-gen offerings with additional performance and\ncapabilities.\nInitial cloud deployments are going very well, and we expect to ramp both internal workloads and public instances throughout 2023.\nFor Enterprise, there are more than 140 fourth-gen EPYC platforms in development from HPE, Dell, Lenovo, Supermicro and others, an increase of\n40% compared to the prior generation.\nNow looking at our broader Data Center portfolio. We had record sales of our Xilinx Data Center and networking products in the quarter, led by\nstrong demand from financial services companies for our newly launched Alveo X3 series boards, optimized for low latency trading. Sales of ourPensando DPUs also ramped significantly from the prior quarter, driven by supply chain improvements and continued demand. We are very pleased\n3\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com  | Contact Us\n©2023 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

In January, we previewed our next-generation MI300 accelerator that will be used for large model AI applications\nin cloud data centers and has been selected to power the 2-plus exaflop El Capitan exascale supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National\nLaboratories. MI300 will be the industry's first data center chip that combines a CPU, GPU and memory into a single integrated design, delivering\n8x more performance and 5x better efficiency for HPC and AI workloads, compared to our MI250 accelerator currently powering the world's fastest\nsuper computer. MI300 is on track to begin sampling to lead customers later this quarter and launch in the second half of 2023.Turning to our Client segment. Revenue declined 51% year-over-year to $903 million. We continue to ship below PC consumption in the fourth\nquarter as we focused on further reducing downstream inventory. While overall PC demand remains soft, desktop channel sell-through increased\nsequentially during the holiday season. We launched our latest generation Ryzen 7000 series notebook processors earlier in January, including our\nRyzen 7040 CPU series that deliver leadership performance in battery life and are our first processors to feature Ryzen AI, the industry's only dedicated\non-chip AI inference engine in an x86 processor. Ryzen AI is powered by the highly scalable XDNA architecture, which is the first integration of\nAMD and Xilinx IP, less than a year after closing the acquisition.\nWe also launched our Ryzen 7045 series CPUs, our first mobile processor based on a chiplet design that delivers significantly higher performance\nthan the competition in gaming and content creation applications. We have more than 250 ultrathin gaming and commercial notebook design\nwins, spanning our full family of Ryzen 7000 series processors on track to launch this year, an increase of 25% year-over-year with the first notebooks\nplanned to go on sale in February.Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 7% year-over-year to $1.6 billion as lower gaming graphics sales more than offset higher\nsemi-custom revenue. Semi-custom SoC revenue grew year-over-year as demand for game consoles remained strong during the holidays. Gaming\ngraphics revenue declined year-over-year as we further reduced desktop GPU downstream channel inventory. Channel sell-through of our Radeon\nRX GPUs increased sequentially, and we launched our high-end Radeon 7900 series GPUs to strong demand based on the performance of our new\nRDNA 3 architecture and 5-nanometer chiplet design.\nIn January, we announced our first RDNA 3 mobile GPUs that have been selected to power new gaming notebooks from Dell, Alienware, ASUS and\nothers that are on track to begin shipping in the first half of 2023.Looking at our Embedded segment. Revenue increased significantly year-over-year to a record $1.4 billion. We had record sales across a number\nof our Embedded markets, including communications, automotive, industrial and health care, aerospace and defense, and test and emulation. In\ncommunications, we saw particular strength with expanded 5G wireless installations in India and ongoing wired infrastructure deployments with\nTier 1 communications providers. Automotive growth was driven by the ramps of new Ford camera, 4D radar and infotainment wins across multiple\ncustomers. We recently announced multiple new wins for our automotive grade Zynq UltraScale+ platforms with some of the largest vehicleequipment suppliers including Aisin next-generation Automated Parking Assist system and DENSO's next-generation LiDAR platform that can\nimprove the resolution required for autonomous driving and other industrial machine vision applications by 20x.\nWe also continued to see strong growth with industrial and health care, aerospace and defense and tested and emulation customers in the quarter,\ndriven by SAM expansion for our leadership-adaptive SoCs, new design win ramps and increased supply across multiple nodes.\nTaking a step back, as we approach the 1-year anniversary of the closing of our Xilinx acquisition next month, the integration has gone extremely\nwell, and our Embedded business has become a major growth driver for AMD, strengthening our financial model and significantly diversifying our\nbusiness. In addition, we are seeing substantial new revenue synergy opportunities as we combine Xilinx's industry-leading adaptive products and\n6,000-plus customers with AMD's expanded breadth of compute products and scale.In summary, overall, 2022 was a strong year for AMD despite the weak PC market. We significantly grew our Data Center, Embedded and Gaming\nbusinesses and executed well across our product portfolio. As we enter 2023, we expect the overall demand environment to remain mixed with\n4\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com  | Contact Us\n©2023 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

We have a strong balance sheet with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment of $5.9 billion at the end of\nthe fourth quarter. During the quarter, we returned $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases. In 2022, we returned a total of $3.7\nbillion to shareholders which was 119% of free cash flow. We have $6.5 billion in remaining authorization to share repurchases. Free cash flow was\n$443 million compared to $736 million in the same quarter last year.\nFree cash flow decreased primarily due to higher inventory. Inventory was $3.8 billion, up approximately $402 million from the prior quarter,\nprimarily driven by the inventory increase in advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products.Now let me turn to our full year financial results. 2022 revenue was $23.6 billion, up 44% year-over-year, driven by increased Embedded, Data\nCenter and the Gaming segment revenue, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. On our combined AMD and Xilinx company basis, 2022\npro forma revenue was $24.1 billion, up 20% compared to $20.1 billion in 2021. Gross margin was 52%, up 370 basis points from the prior year,\nprimarily driven by richer product mix with higher revenue from Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment\nrevenue.\nOperating expenses were 26% of revenue compared to 24% in 2021. 2022 operating income was $6.3 billion, up $2.3 billion, an increase of 56%\nfrom a year ago resulting in operating margin of 27% compared to 25% in 2021, primarily driven by higher revenue and gross margin expansion.\nNet income was $5.5 billion compared to $3.4 billion, up 60% from the prior year. Earnings per share was $3.50 compared to $2.79 for the prior\nyear, primarily due to Data Center growth and addition of Xilinx.\nFull year free cash flow was $3.1 billion, resulting free cash flow margin of 13% for the year. We invested approximately $1 billion in long-term\nsupply chain capacity in 2022 to support our expectations for future revenue growth and increase market share.Let me now turn to our financial outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current macro environment. For\nthe first quarter of 2023, we expect revenue to be approximately $5.3 billion, plus or minus $300 million, a decrease of approximately 10%\nyear-over-year and 5% sequentially. Year-over-year Data Center and Embedded segment revenue are expected to grow, offset by lower Client and\nGaming segment revenue. Sequentially, Embedded segment revenue is expected to increase. Client and Gaming segment revenue are expected\nto decline largely consistent with seasonality. Data Center segment revenue is expected to decline due to elevated levels of inventory with some\ncloud customers.",

          "content": "Now let me turn to our full year financial results. 2022 revenue was $23.6 billion, up 44% year-over-year, driven by increased Embedded, Data\nCenter and the Gaming segment revenue, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. On our combined AMD and Xilinx company basis, 2022\npro forma revenue was $24.1 billion, up 20% compared to $20.1 billion in 2021. Gross margin was 52%, up 370 basis points from the prior year,\nprimarily driven by richer product mix with higher revenue from Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment\nrevenue.\nOperating expenses were 26% of revenue compared to 24% in 2021. 2022 operating income was $6.3 billion, up $2.3 billion, an increase of 56%\nfrom a year ago resulting in operating margin of 27% compared to 25% in 2021, primarily driven by higher revenue and gross margin expansion.\nNet income was $5.5 billion compared to $3.4 billion, up 60% from the prior year. Earnings per share was $3.50 compared to $2.79 for the prior\nyear, primarily due to Data Center growth and addition of Xilinx.\nFull year free cash flow was $3.1 billion, resulting free cash flow margin of 13% for the year. We invested approximately $1 billion in long-term\nsupply chain capacity in 2022 to support our expectations for future revenue growth and increase market share.Let me now turn to our financial outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current macro environment. For\nthe first quarter of 2023, we expect revenue to be approximately $5.3 billion, plus or minus $300 million, a decrease of approximately 10%\nyear-over-year and 5% sequentially. Year-over-year Data Center and Embedded segment revenue are expected to grow, offset by lower Client and\nGaming segment revenue. Sequentially, Embedded segment revenue is expected to increase. Client and Gaming segment revenue are expected\nto decline largely consistent with seasonality. Data Center segment revenue is expected to decline due to elevated levels of inventory with some\ncloud customers.In addition, for Q1 2023, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 50%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.6\nbillion; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $146 million based on a 13% effective tax rate. Diluted share count is\nexpected to be approximately 1.62 billion shares. For the full year of 2023, we are not providing specific guidance due to the uncertainty in the\nmacro environment. However, let me provide some color.\nDirectionally, we expect Embedded and Data Center annual revenue to grow from 2022 based on the strength of our product portfolio and expected\nshare gains. In addition, we expect Client and the Gaming segment revenue to decline based on the current demand environment. We expectnon-GAAP gross margin to be approximately flattish in the first half and the expansion in the second half of the year. We expect to manage quarterly\nnon-GAAP operating expenses flat with the fourth quarter until we see the demand environment improves. For modeling purpose, we expect\nnon-GAAP effective tax rate for the year to be 13% and the diluted share count to be approximately 1.62 billion shares.\nIn closing, we had a strong year with record revenue and profitability, driven by our leadership in product portfolio and the diversification of our\nbusiness. Looking forward to 2023, as Lisa mentioned earlier, we'll continue to focus on executing our long-term growth strategy while drivingfinancial discipline and operational excellence. We believe our leadership of products, growing customer momentum and strong financial foundation\nposition us well for long-term profitable growth.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Ruth for a Q&A.\nsession.\n6\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com  | Contact Us\n©2023 Refinitiv.

Operator, if you could poll the audience for questions now, please.\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen.\nMatthew D. Ramsay  - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst\nYes. First of all, congratulations, Jean. And congrats as well to Devinder. I mean the last 5 years of the company have been remarkable, but I remember\nall the work you and your finance team did 6 or 7 years ago to keep the foundation stable for what's happened since. So enjoy the retirement.My first question, Lisa, is just about the drivers of 2023. You guys talked in the prepared script about all the different crosscurrents that are kind of\ngoing on right now versus the strength of your portfolio versus some inventory digestion in the Data Center space and obviously, what's going on\nin the PC market. But I've gotten about a zillion versions of the same question tonight, which was do you think the company can grow for the year\n2023 overall? And if you could just kind of walk us through the drivers of the business as we work through the year.\nLisa Su  - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Chair of the Board\nYes, absolutely, Matt. Thanks for the question. So there are lots of puts and takes in 2023, and we want to give you kind of some of the drivers. Ourlargest growth driver is certainly the Data Center. We are very positioned well with our product portfolio. We just launched our Genoa 4th Gen\nEPYC. We also have Bergamo coming this year as well.\nWhen we talk to our cloud customers, what they're telling us is they appreciate the execution of our road map. And we have an opportunity to\nmove more workloads to AMD as we go through the year. So we feel very good about our product positioning.\nAs we mentioned in the prepared remarks, coming off of a very strong 2022, there is some inventory at some of the cloud customers. And so we\nare expecting a softer first half and then a stronger second half, but we feel very good about our market share position and opportunity to growwith Data Center. Also on the Embedded side, I would say we have a very strong portfolio there. The Xilinx business has done very well in 2022. It's\na diversified set of markets. We see strength in a number of the end markets. And so we think that's also a grower for AMD.\nOn the other side, our Client and Gaming businesses, we believe, will decline. We have made good progress. When we look at the PC markets in\nthe second half of the year of 2022, we were really trying to rebalance inventory, and I think we made progress exiting Q4. We're still expecting to\nship below consumption in the first quarter and then sort of go from there. Our product portfolio is strong. We think there's an opportunity forgrowth as we go into the second half of the year. But we think overall for the year, client will decline just given the TAM.\nAnd then on the Gaming segment, again, we're coming off of a very strong 2022. And so console demand has been actually quite strong. And\ngiven where we are in the cycle, we would expect gaming to be down on a year-over-year basis. But overall, I think lots of puts and takes, but we're\npositive on what we can do in terms of the Data Center and the Embedded segments, given our product portfolio. And we'll watch the macro on\nthe Client and Gaming and see how that plays out.\n7\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com  | Contact Us",

As we talk about it, it's both our Embedded and Data Center segment have strong\ngross margins. So we feel pretty good about second half.\nWe continue to have the growth of both Embedded and Data Center segment. The major headwind we are facing is really Client side, which if you\nthink about the gross margin in the first half of 2022 versus the first half of 2023, the major impact is from the client revenue, inventory correction,\nwhich impact the gross margin in the Client segment.So going into second half, the normalization of the Client segment will help us to expand the gross margin. I think it really depends on how the\nClient segment will recover. That will drive the gross margin if it's going to go back to the first half of 2022 or expand beyond that level. But overall,\nwe feel pretty good. Once we normalize the Client segment, our gross margin will continue to expand.\n9\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com  | Contact Us\n©2023 Refinitiv.

I think it depends a bit on what happens\nin the macro environment. But we do feel good about second half expansion, and we'll see sort of the relative recovery in macro as it relates to all\nof our segments.\nStacy Aaron Rasgon  - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior AnalystGot it. I guess for my follow-up, maybe it follows up on that a little bit more just around the mix. I get how Data Center and Embedded should be\ngrowing in the second half versus the first half. But presumably, Client will, too, first half to second half, given that you are under-shipping, it sounds\nlike by a pretty wide margin right now. How do you feel about your mix just across the 4 businesses of the second half versus the first half?\nDo you think your Data Center plus Embedded mix, as a percentage of total revenue in the second half, is materially higher than it is in the first\nhalf? Or I mean could it even be not that different at all given the potential growth that you might see just from the channel normalization in clients?Lisa Su  - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Chair of the Board\nYes. I think the way to think about it is, I think our Data Center grow -- growth in the second half versus first half, we expect that to be significantly\nstronger. As it relates to clients, we would also expect it to be stronger. Again, depending a bit on macro and sort of how the TAM actually evolves.\nI think for the Embedded businesses, I would say that we expect to grow over the full year 2023 versus 2022. What we see right now is a fairly strong\nbacklog and good visibility into the first half of the year. I'm not ready to say that Embedded will grow in the second half versus the first half, though,\nbecause we're coming off very strong growth already.

          "content": "Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). A GPU is a programmable logic chip that helps render images, animations and video\nand is increasingly being used to handle general computing tasks. GPUs are located in plug-in cards, as a discrete processor\nor in a chip on the motherboard, or in the same chip as the CPU as part of an accelerated processing unit (APU) or System-\non-Chip (SoC). GPUs on stand-alone cards or discrete GPUs on the motherboard typically access their own memory, while\nGPUs in the chipset or CPU chip share main memory with the CPU.\nGPUs perform parallel operations on data to render images for a video display and are essential to presenting computer\ngenerated images on that display, decoding and rendering animations and displaying video. The more sophisticated the GPU,\nthe higher the resolution and the faster and smoother moving objects can be displayed on video display or in a virtual\nenvironment (virtual and augmented realities).\nIn addition to graphics processing, GPUs are used to perform parallel operations on multiple sets of data and are\nincreasingly used to perform vector processing for non-graphics applications that require repetitive computations such as\nsupercomputing, deep learning, artificial and machine intelligence, and various other applications (e.g., cryptocurrency\nmining).Accelerated Processing Unit (APU). Consumers increasingly demand computing devices with improved end-user\nexperience, system performance and energy efficiency. Consumers also continue to demand thinner and lighter mobile\ndevices, with better performance and longer battery life. We believe that a computing architecture that optimizes the use of\nits components can provide these improvements.\nAn APU is a processing unit that integrates a CPU and a GPU onto one chip (or one piece of silicon), along with, in\nsome cases, other special-purpose components. This integration enhances system performance by “offloading” selected tasks\nto the best-suited component (i.e., the CPU or the GPU) to optimize component use, increasing the speed of data flowbetween the CPU and GPU through shared memory and allowing the GPU to function as both a graphics engine and an\napplication accelerator. Having the CPU and GPU on the same chip also typically improves energy efficiency by, for\nexample, eliminating connections between discrete chips.\nHeterogeneous System Architecture (HSA) describes an industry standard that is an overarching design for having\ncombinations of CPU and GPU processor cores that operate as a unified, integrated engine that shares system responsibilities\nand resources. AMD is a founding member of the HSA Foundation, a non-profit organization established to define and\npromote this open standards-based approach to heterogeneous computing. Heterogeneous computing allows for the elevation\nof the GPU to the same level of the CPU for memory access, queuing and execution. This capability allows software\nprogrammers to develop applications to more fully utilize GPU capabilities.System-on-Chip (SoC) . An SoC is a type of IC with a CPU, GPU and other components, such as a memory controller\nand peripheral management, comprising a complete computing system on a single chip. By combining all of these elements\nas an SoC, system performance and energy efficiency is improved, similar to an APU.\nChipset. A chipset is a generic term referring to a collection of system level components that manage data flow among a\nmicroprocessor or microprocessors, memory and peripherals (such as CD ROM drives, DVD drives and USB peripherals).\nChipsets perform essential logic functions, balance a system’s performance and provide system control and power\nmanagement functions. Some chipsets have graphics capabilities by including an integrated graphics processor (IGP) within\nthe chipset. A chipset with an IGP is known as an IGP chipset. IGP chipsets can offer a lower cost, reduced power alternative\nto a discrete GPU, and are often also used in smaller form factors. Systems that are powered by an APU or by a CPU and\ndiscrete GPU combination often do not have a chipset and instead use an AMD Controller Hub chip to perform the functions\nof a chipset. As a result, we believe that either an APU and AMD Controller Hub chip combination or an SoC, which already\nincludes a chipset, will eventually replace the market for IGP chipsets.Our x86 Microprocessor and Chipset Products\nOur microprocessors are incorporated into computing platforms, which are a collection of technologies that are designed\nto work together to provide a more complete computing solution and to enable and advance the computing components. We\nbelieve that integrated, balanced computing platforms consisting of microprocessors, chipsets (either as discrete devices or\nintegrated into an SoC) and GPUs (either as discrete GPUs or integrated into an APU or SoC) that work together at the\nsystem level bring end users improved system stability, increased performance and enhanced power efficiency. In addition,\nwe believe our customers also benefit from an all-AMD platform (consisting of an APU or CPU, a discrete GPU, and anAMD Fusion Controller Hub chip when needed), as we are able to optimize interoperability, provide our customers a single\npoint of contact for the key platform components and enable them to bring the platforms to market faster in a variety of\nclient and server system form factors.\n4February 27, 2018 - 10-K: Annual report pursuant to Section 13 and 1... https://ir.amd.com/financial-information/sec-filings/content/0000002...\n9 von 188 20.10.2025, 13:17\nWe currently base our microprocessors and chipsets on the x86 instruction set architecture and the AMD Direct Connect\nArchitecture, which connects an on-chip memory controller and input/output (I/O) channels directly to one or moremicroprocessor cores. We typically integrate two or more processor cores onto a single die, and each core has its own\ndedicated cache, which is memory that is located on the semiconductor die, permitting quick access to frequently used data\nand instructions. Some of our microprocessors have additional levels of cache such as L2, or second-level cache, and L3, or\nthird-level cache, to enable faster data access and higher performance.\nWe focus on continually improving the energy efficiency of our products through our design principles and innovations\nin power management technology. To that end, we offer CPUs, GPUs, APUs, SoCs and chipsets with multiple low power\nstates that are designed to utilize lower clock speeds and voltages to reduce processor power consumption during active and\nidle times. The use of intelligent, dynamic power management is designed to create lower energy use by allowing compute\napplications to be completed quickly and efficiently, enabling a return to the ultra-low power idle state.",

          "content": "Turning to our Client segment. Revenue declined 51% year-over-year to $903 million. We continue to ship below PC consumption in the fourth\nquarter as we focused on further reducing downstream inventory. While overall PC demand remains soft, desktop channel sell-through increased\nsequentially during the holiday season. We launched our latest generation Ryzen 7000 series notebook processors earlier in January, including our\nRyzen 7040 CPU series that deliver leadership performance in battery life and are our first processors to feature Ryzen AI, the industry's only dedicated\non-chip AI inference engine in an x86 processor. Ryzen AI is powered by the highly scalable XDNA architecture, which is the first integration of\nAMD and Xilinx IP, less than a year after closing the acquisition.\nWe also launched our Ryzen 7045 series CPUs, our first mobile processor based on a chiplet design that delivers significantly higher performance\nthan the competition in gaming and content creation applications. We have more than 250 ultrathin gaming and commercial notebook design\nwins, spanning our full family of Ryzen 7000 series processors on track to launch this year, an increase of 25% year-over-year with the first notebooks\nplanned to go on sale in February.Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 7% year-over-year to $1.6 billion as lower gaming graphics sales more than offset higher\nsemi-custom revenue. Semi-custom SoC revenue grew year-over-year as demand for game consoles remained strong during the holidays. Gaming\ngraphics revenue declined year-over-year as we further reduced desktop GPU downstream channel inventory. Channel sell-through of our Radeon\nRX GPUs increased sequentially, and we launched our high-end Radeon 7900 series GPUs to strong demand based on the performance of our new\nRDNA 3 architecture and 5-nanometer chiplet design.\nIn January, we announced our first RDNA 3 mobile GPUs that have been selected to power new gaming notebooks from Dell, Alienware, ASUS and\nothers that are on track to begin shipping in the first half of 2023.Looking at our Embedded segment. Revenue increased significantly year-over-year to a record $1.4 billion. We had record sales across a number\nof our Embedded markets, including communications, automotive, industrial and health care, aerospace and defense, and test and emulation. In\ncommunications, we saw particular strength with expanded 5G wireless installations in India and ongoing wired infrastructure deployments with\nTier 1 communications providers. Automotive growth was driven by the ramps of new Ford camera, 4D radar and infotainment wins across multiple\ncustomers. We recently announced multiple new wins for our automotive grade Zynq UltraScale+ platforms with some of the largest vehicleequipment suppliers including Aisin next-generation Automated Parking Assist system and DENSO's next-generation LiDAR platform that can\nimprove the resolution required for autonomous driving and other industrial machine vision applications by 20x.\nWe also continued to see strong growth with industrial and health care, aerospace and defense and tested and emulation customers in the quarter,\ndriven by SAM expansion for our leadership-adaptive SoCs, new design win ramps and increased supply across multiple nodes.\nTaking a step back, as we approach the 1-year anniversary of the closing of our Xilinx acquisition next month, the integration has gone extremely\nwell, and our Embedded business has become a major growth driver for AMD, strengthening our financial model and significantly diversifying our\nbusiness. In addition, we are seeing substantial new revenue synergy opportunities as we combine Xilinx's industry-leading adaptive products and\n6,000-plus customers with AMD's expanded breadth of compute products and scale.In summary, overall, 2022 was a strong year for AMD despite the weak PC market. We significantly grew our Data Center, Embedded and Gaming\nbusinesses and executed well across our product portfolio. As we enter 2023, we expect the overall demand environment to remain mixed with\n4\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com  | Contact Us\n©2023 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

In the PC market, we are planning for the PC TAM to be down approximately 10% for 2023. We expect\nto continue to ship below consumption in the first quarter to reduce downstream inventory, which is reflected in our guidance.\nIn our Embedded and Data Center segments, we believe we are well positioned to grow revenue and gain share in 2023 based on the strength of\nour competitive positioning and leadership high-performance and adaptive product portfolio. We do see elevated levels of inventory with some\ncloud customers, which will lead to a softer first half and a stronger second half of the year. We continue working very closely with our customersto navigate the dynamic market conditions while also making the right strategic investments to exit the current cycle with an even stronger and\nmore differentiated set of products to drive future growth.\nOver the next several years, one of our largest growth opportunities is in AI, which is in the early stages of transforming virtually every industry\nservice and product. We expect AI adoption will accelerate significantly over the coming years and are incredibly excited about leveraging our\nbroad portfolio of CPUs, GPUs and adaptive accelerators in combination with our software expertise to deliver differentiated solutions that can\naddress the full spectrum of AI needs in training and inference across cloud, edge and client.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year financial results. Jean?Jean X. Hu  - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. 2022 was a very strong year for AMD. We had a record revenue, gross margin, profitability, and we\ngenerated significant free cash flow. The year was also highlighted by our strategic acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando, expanding and diversifying\nour business portfolio.\nFourth quarter 2022 revenue for $5.6 billion was up 16% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue in the Embedded and Data Center segment,\npartially offset by lower Client and the Gaming segment revenue. Gross margin was 51%, up 70 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by\nricher product mix with higher revenue in Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. Operatingexpenses were $1.6 billion compared to $1.1 billion a year ago, driven by the inclusion of Xilinx OpEx and additional R&D and go-to-market\ninvestments to support the next phase of our revenue growth.\nOperating income declined $66 million from a year ago to $1.3 billion, and the operating margin was 23%, down from 27% a year ago. Net income\nwas $1.1 billion flat year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.92 per share a year ago, primarily due to lower client\noperating income.\nNow turning to our reportable segment for the fourth quarter. Starting with the Data Center segment. Revenue was $1.7 billion, up 42% year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by strong growth in third-generation EPYC server processor revenue and the early ramp of fourth-generation EPYC processors.Data center operating income was $444 million or 27% of revenue compared to $369 million or 32% a year ago. Higher operating income was\ndriven primarily by stronger revenue, partially offset by higher R&D investment to support the top line revenue growth.\nClient segment revenue was $903 million, down 51% year-over-year due to reduced processor shipments resulting from a weak PC market and\nsignificant inventory correction across the PC supply chain. Client operating loss was $152 million compared to operating income of $530 million\na year ago or 29% of revenue, primarily due to lower revenue.\nGaming segment revenue was $1.6 billion, down 7% year-over-year due to lower gaming graphics revenue, partially offset by higher semi-customerproduct sales. Gaming operating income was $266 million or 16% of revenue compared to $407 million or 23% a year ago. The decrease was\nprimarily due to lower graphics revenue.\nEmbedded segment revenue was $1.4 billion, up $1.3 billion from a year ago, primarily due to the inclusion of Xilinx Embedded revenue.

We have a strong balance sheet with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment of $5.9 billion at the end of\nthe fourth quarter. During the quarter, we returned $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases. In 2022, we returned a total of $3.7\nbillion to shareholders which was 119% of free cash flow. We have $6.5 billion in remaining authorization to share repurchases. Free cash flow was\n$443 million compared to $736 million in the same quarter last year.\nFree cash flow decreased primarily due to higher inventory. Inventory was $3.8 billion, up approximately $402 million from the prior quarter,\nprimarily driven by the inventory increase in advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products.Now let me turn to our full year financial results. 2022 revenue was $23.6 billion, up 44% year-over-year, driven by increased Embedded, Data\nCenter and the Gaming segment revenue, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. On our combined AMD and Xilinx company basis, 2022\npro forma revenue was $24.1 billion, up 20% compared to $20.1 billion in 2021. Gross margin was 52%, up 370 basis points from the prior year,\nprimarily driven by richer product mix with higher revenue from Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment\nrevenue.\nOperating expenses were 26% of revenue compared to 24% in 2021. 2022 operating income was $6.3 billion, up $2.3 billion, an increase of 56%\nfrom a year ago resulting in operating margin of 27% compared to 25% in 2021, primarily driven by higher revenue and gross margin expansion.\nNet income was $5.5 billion compared to $3.4 billion, up 60% from the prior year. Earnings per share was $3.50 compared to $2.79 for the prior\nyear, primarily due to Data Center growth and addition of Xilinx.\nFull year free cash flow was $3.1 billion, resulting free cash flow margin of 13% for the year. We invested approximately $1 billion in long-term\nsupply chain capacity in 2022 to support our expectations for future revenue growth and increase market share.Let me now turn to our financial outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current macro environment. For\nthe first quarter of 2023, we expect revenue to be approximately $5.3 billion, plus or minus $300 million, a decrease of approximately 10%\nyear-over-year and 5% sequentially. Year-over-year Data Center and Embedded segment revenue are expected to grow, offset by lower Client and\nGaming segment revenue. Sequentially, Embedded segment revenue is expected to increase. Client and Gaming segment revenue are expected\nto decline largely consistent with seasonality. Data Center segment revenue is expected to decline due to elevated levels of inventory with some\ncloud customers.",

The year was also highlighted by our strategic acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando, expanding and diversifying\nour business portfolio.\nFourth quarter 2022 revenue for $5.6 billion was up 16% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue in the Embedded and Data Center segment,\npartially offset by lower Client and the Gaming segment revenue. Gross margin was 51%, up 70 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by\nricher product mix with higher revenue in Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. Operatingexpenses were $1.6 billion compared to $1.1 billion a year ago, driven by the inclusion of Xilinx OpEx and additional R&D and go-to-market\ninvestments to support the next phase of our revenue growth.\nOperating income declined $66 million from a year ago to $1.3 billion, and the operating margin was 23%, down from 27% a year ago. Net income\nwas $1.1 billion flat year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.92 per share a year ago, primarily due to lower client\noperating income.\nNow turning to our reportable segment for the fourth quarter. Starting with the Data Center segment. Revenue was $1.7 billion, up 42% year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by strong growth in third-generation EPYC server processor revenue and the early ramp of fourth-generation EPYC processors.Data center operating income was $444 million or 27% of revenue compared to $369 million or 32% a year ago. Higher operating income was\ndriven primarily by stronger revenue, partially offset by higher R&D investment to support the top line revenue growth.\nClient segment revenue was $903 million, down 51% year-over-year due to reduced processor shipments resulting from a weak PC market and\nsignificant inventory correction across the PC supply chain. Client operating loss was $152 million compared to operating income of $530 million\na year ago or 29% of revenue, primarily due to lower revenue.\nGaming segment revenue was $1.6 billion, down 7% year-over-year due to lower gaming graphics revenue, partially offset by higher semi-customerproduct sales. Gaming operating income was $266 million or 16% of revenue compared to $407 million or 23% a year ago. The decrease was\nprimarily due to lower graphics revenue.\nEmbedded segment revenue was $1.4 billion, up $1.3 billion from a year ago, primarily due to the inclusion of Xilinx Embedded revenue. Embedded\noperating income was $699 million or 50% of revenue compared to $18 million or 25% a year ago, primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx.\n5\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com  | Contact Us\n©2023 Refinitiv.

We have a strong balance sheet with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment of $5.9 billion at the end of\nthe fourth quarter. During the quarter, we returned $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases. In 2022, we returned a total of $3.7\nbillion to shareholders which was 119% of free cash flow. We have $6.5 billion in remaining authorization to share repurchases. Free cash flow was\n$443 million compared to $736 million in the same quarter last year.\nFree cash flow decreased primarily due to higher inventory. Inventory was $3.8 billion, up approximately $402 million from the prior quarter,\nprimarily driven by the inventory increase in advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products.Now let me turn to our full year financial results. 2022 revenue was $23.6 billion, up 44% year-over-year, driven by increased Embedded, Data\nCenter and the Gaming segment revenue, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. On our combined AMD and Xilinx company basis, 2022\npro forma revenue was $24.1 billion, up 20% compared to $20.1 billion in 2021. Gross margin was 52%, up 370 basis points from the prior year,\nprimarily driven by richer product mix with higher revenue from Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment\nrevenue.\nOperating expenses were 26% of revenue compared to 24% in 2021. 2022 operating income was $6.3 billion, up $2.3 billion, an increase of 56%\nfrom a year ago resulting in operating margin of 27% compared to 25% in 2021, primarily driven by higher revenue and gross margin expansion.\nNet income was $5.5 billion compared to $3.4 billion, up 60% from the prior year. Earnings per share was $3.50 compared to $2.79 for the prior\nyear, primarily due to Data Center growth and addition of Xilinx.\nFull year free cash flow was $3.1 billion, resulting free cash flow margin of 13% for the year. We invested approximately $1 billion in long-term\nsupply chain capacity in 2022 to support our expectations for future revenue growth and increase market share.Let me now turn to our financial outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current macro environment. For\nthe first quarter of 2023, we expect revenue to be approximately $5.3 billion, plus or minus $300 million, a decrease of approximately 10%\nyear-over-year and 5% sequentially. Year-over-year Data Center and Embedded segment revenue are expected to grow, offset by lower Client and\nGaming segment revenue. Sequentially, Embedded segment revenue is expected to increase. Client and Gaming segment revenue are expected\nto decline largely consistent with seasonality. Data Center segment revenue is expected to decline due to elevated levels of inventory with some\ncloud customers.In addition, for Q1 2023, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 50%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.6\nbillion; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $146 million based on a 13% effective tax rate. Diluted share count is\nexpected to be approximately 1.62 billion shares. For the full year of 2023, we are not providing specific guidance due to the uncertainty in the\nmacro environment. However, let me provide some color.\nDirectionally, we expect Embedded and Data Center annual revenue to grow from 2022 based on the strength of our product portfolio and expected\nshare gains. In addition, we expect Client and the Gaming segment revenue to decline based on the current demand environment. We expect",

These forward-looking outlook statements and non-GAAP measures are based on current expectations as of January 31, 2023, and assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks anduncertainties. AMD undertakes no intent or obligation to publicly update or revise its outlook statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\nAll items, except revenue, are on a non-GAAP basis. Adjustments to arrive at the GAAP financial outlook typically include stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, income\ntax provision, equity income in investee, and other non- recurring items such as loss on debt redemption/conversion, impairment charges and acquisition-related costs. The timing and impact of such\nadjustments are dependent on future events that are typically uncertain or outside of AMD's control, therefore, a reconciliation to equivalent GAAP measures is not practicable at this time. 2.

The year was also highlighted by our strategic acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando, expanding and diversifying\nour business portfolio.\nFourth quarter 2022 revenue for $5.6 billion was up 16% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue in the Embedded and Data Center segment,\npartially offset by lower Client and the Gaming segment revenue. Gross margin was 51%, up 70 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by\nricher product mix with higher revenue in Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. Operatingexpenses were $1.6 billion compared to $1.1 billion a year ago, driven by the inclusion of Xilinx OpEx and additional R&D and go-to-market\ninvestments to support the next phase of our revenue growth.\nOperating income declined $66 million from a year ago to $1.3 billion, and the operating margin was 23%, down from 27% a year ago. Net income\nwas $1.1 billion flat year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.92 per share a year ago, primarily due to lower client\noperating income.\nNow turning to our reportable segment for the fourth quarter. Starting with the Data Center segment.

Higher operating income was\ndriven primarily by stronger revenue, partially offset by higher R&D investment to support the top line revenue growth.\nClient segment revenue was $903 million, down 51% year-over-year due to reduced processor shipments resulting from a weak PC market and\nsignificant inventory correction across the PC supply chain. Client operating loss was $152 million compared to operating income of $530 million\na year ago or 29% of revenue, primarily due to lower revenue.\nGaming segment revenue was $1.6 billion, down 7% year-over-year due to lower gaming graphics revenue, partially offset by higher semi-customer",

Revenue increased 42% year-over-year to $1.7 billion, led\nby increased adoption of our EPYC processors by cloud providers. In cloud, sales to North American hyperscalers more than doubled year-over-year\nas hyperscale customers continued moving more of their internal workloads and external instances to EPYC processors. EPYC processors now\npower more than 600 publicly available instances globally following the launches of new AMD-based instances from AWS, Microsoft and others\nin the quarter.\nIn Enterprise, revenue declined year-over-year as demand slowed based on the macro environment. Against this backdrop, we continue expandingour pipeline and closed a number of new wins in the fourth quarter with Fortune 500 financial services, automotive, technology, energy and\naerospace companies. In HPC, growing EPYC processor adoption was highlighted by the number of AMD-powered supercomputers on the latest\ntop 500 list increasing by 38% year-over-year. AMD now powers more than 100 of the world's fastest supercomputers and 15 of the top 20 most\nenergy-efficient supercomputers in the world.\nTo build our Data Center leadership, we launched our fourth gen EPYC processors this past November that deliver up to 2x faster performance in\ncloud, enterprise and HPC applications, and are up to 80% more energy efficient than the competition's most recently announced offerings. Weare seeing very strong customer pull for fourth-gen EPYC CPUs, which complement our third-gen offerings with additional performance and\ncapabilities.\nInitial cloud deployments are going very well, and we expect to ramp both internal workloads and public instances throughout 2023.\nFor Enterprise, there are more than 140 fourth-gen EPYC platforms in development from HPE, Dell, Lenovo, Supermicro and others, an increase of\n40% compared to the prior generation.\nNow looking at our broader Data Center portfolio. We had record sales of our Xilinx Data Center and networking products in the quarter, led by\nstrong demand from financial services companies for our newly launched Alveo X3 series boards, optimized for low latency trading.

We continue to ship below PC consumption in the fourth\nquarter as we focused on further reducing downstream inventory. While overall PC demand remains soft, desktop channel sell-through increased\nsequentially during the holiday season. We launched our latest generation Ryzen 7000 series notebook processors earlier in January, including our\nRyzen 7040 CPU series that deliver leadership performance in battery life and are our first processors to feature Ryzen AI, the industry's only dedicated\non-chip AI inference engine in an x86 processor. Ryzen AI is powered by the highly scalable XDNA architecture, which is the first integration of\nAMD and Xilinx IP, less than a year after closing the acquisition.\nWe also launched our Ryzen 7045 series CPUs, our first mobile processor based on a chiplet design that delivers significantly higher performance\nthan the competition in gaming and content creation applications. We have more than 250 ultrathin gaming and commercial notebook design\nwins, spanning our full family of Ryzen 7000 series processors on track to launch this year, an increase of 25% year-over-year with the first notebooks\nplanned to go on sale in February.Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 7% year-over-year to $1.6 billion as lower gaming graphics sales more than offset higher\nsemi-custom revenue. Semi-custom SoC revenue grew year-over-year as demand for game consoles remained strong during the holidays. Gaming\ngraphics revenue declined year-over-year as we further reduced desktop GPU downstream channel inventory. Channel sell-through of our Radeon\nRX GPUs increased sequentially, and we launched our high-end Radeon 7900 series GPUs to strong demand based on the performance of our new\nRDNA 3 architecture and 5-nanometer chiplet design.\nIn January, we announced our first RDNA 3 mobile GPUs that have been selected to power new gaming notebooks from Dell, Alienware, ASUS and\nothers that are on track to begin shipping in the first half of 2023.Looking at our Embedded segment. Revenue increased significantly year-over-year to a record $1.4 billion. We had record sales across a number\nof our Embedded markets, including communications, automotive, industrial and health care, aerospace and defense, and test and emulation. In\ncommunications, we saw particular strength with expanded 5G wireless installations in India and ongoing wired infrastructure deployments with\nTier 1 communications providers. Automotive growth was driven by the ramps of new Ford camera, 4D radar and infotainment wins across multiple\ncustomers. We recently announced multiple new wins for our automotive grade Zynq UltraScale+ platforms with some of the largest vehicleequipment suppliers including Aisin next-generation Automated Parking Assist system and DENSO's next-generation LiDAR platform that can\nimprove the resolution required for autonomous driving and other industrial machine vision applications by 20x.\nWe also continued to see strong growth with industrial and health care, aerospace and defense and tested and emulation customers in the quarter,\ndriven by SAM expansion for our leadership-adaptive SoCs, new design win ramps and increased supply across multiple nodes.\nTaking a step back, as we approach the 1-year anniversary of the closing of our Xilinx acquisition next month, the integration has gone extremely\nwell, and our Embedded business has become a major growth driver for AMD, strengthening our financial model and significantly diversifying our\nbusiness. In addition, we are seeing substantial new revenue synergy opportunities as we combine Xilinx's industry-leading adaptive products and\n6,000-plus customers with AMD's expanded breadth of compute products and scale.In summary, overall, 2022 was a strong year for AMD despite the weak PC market.

          "content": "Jean X. Hu  - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. 2022 was a very strong year for AMD. We had a record revenue, gross margin, profitability, and we\ngenerated significant free cash flow. The year was also highlighted by our strategic acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando, expanding and diversifying\nour business portfolio.\nFourth quarter 2022 revenue for $5.6 billion was up 16% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue in the Embedded and Data Center segment,\npartially offset by lower Client and the Gaming segment revenue. Gross margin was 51%, up 70 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by\nricher product mix with higher revenue in Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. Operatingexpenses were $1.6 billion compared to $1.1 billion a year ago, driven by the inclusion of Xilinx OpEx and additional R&D and go-to-market\ninvestments to support the next phase of our revenue growth.\nOperating income declined $66 million from a year ago to $1.3 billion, and the operating margin was 23%, down from 27% a year ago. Net income\nwas $1.1 billion flat year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.92 per share a year ago, primarily due to lower client\noperating income.\nNow turning to our reportable segment for the fourth quarter. Starting with the Data Center segment. Revenue was $1.7 billion, up 42% year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by strong growth in third-generation EPYC server processor revenue and the early ramp of fourth-generation EPYC processors.Data center operating income was $444 million or 27% of revenue compared to $369 million or 32% a year ago. Higher operating income was\ndriven primarily by stronger revenue, partially offset by higher R&D investment to support the top line revenue growth.\nClient segment revenue was $903 million, down 51% year-over-year due to reduced processor shipments resulting from a weak PC market and\nsignificant inventory correction across the PC supply chain. Client operating loss was $152 million compared to operating income of $530 million\na year ago or 29% of revenue, primarily due to lower revenue.\nGaming segment revenue was $1.6 billion, down 7% year-over-year due to lower gaming graphics revenue, partially offset by higher semi-customerproduct sales. Gaming operating income was $266 million or 16% of revenue compared to $407 million or 23% a year ago. The decrease was\nprimarily due to lower graphics revenue.\nEmbedded segment revenue was $1.4 billion, up $1.3 billion from a year ago, primarily due to the inclusion of Xilinx Embedded revenue. Embedded\noperating income was $699 million or 50% of revenue compared to $18 million or 25% a year ago, primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx.\n5\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com  | Contact Us\n©2023 Refinitiv.

We have a strong balance sheet with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment of $5.9 billion at the end of\nthe fourth quarter. During the quarter, we returned $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases. In 2022, we returned a total of $3.7\nbillion to shareholders which was 119% of free cash flow. We have $6.5 billion in remaining authorization to share repurchases. Free cash flow was\n$443 million compared to $736 million in the same quarter last year.\nFree cash flow decreased primarily due to higher inventory. Inventory was $3.8 billion, up approximately $402 million from the prior quarter,\nprimarily driven by the inventory increase in advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products.Now let me turn to our full year financial results. 2022 revenue was $23.6 billion, up 44% year-over-year, driven by increased Embedded, Data\nCenter and the Gaming segment revenue, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. On our combined AMD and Xilinx company basis, 2022\npro forma revenue was $24.1 billion, up 20% compared to $20.1 billion in 2021. Gross margin was 52%, up 370 basis points from the prior year,\nprimarily driven by richer product mix with higher revenue from Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment\nrevenue.\nOperating expenses were 26% of revenue compared to 24% in 2021. 2022 operating income was $6.3 billion, up $2.3 billion, an increase of 56%\nfrom a year ago resulting in operating margin of 27% compared to 25% in 2021, primarily driven by higher revenue and gross margin expansion.\nNet income was $5.5 billion compared to $3.4 billion, up 60% from the prior year. Earnings per share was $3.50 compared to $2.79 for the prior\nyear, primarily due to Data Center growth and addition of Xilinx.\nFull year free cash flow was $3.1 billion, resulting free cash flow margin of 13% for the year. We invested approximately $1 billion in long-term\nsupply chain capacity in 2022 to support our expectations for future revenue growth and increase market share.Let me now turn to our financial outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current macro environment. For\nthe first quarter of 2023, we expect revenue to be approximately $5.3 billion, plus or minus $300 million, a decrease of approximately 10%\nyear-over-year and 5% sequentially. Year-over-year Data Center and Embedded segment revenue are expected to grow, offset by lower Client and\nGaming segment revenue. Sequentially, Embedded segment revenue is expected to increase. Client and Gaming segment revenue are expected\nto decline largely consistent with seasonality. Data Center segment revenue is expected to decline due to elevated levels of inventory with some\ncloud customers.In addition, for Q1 2023, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 50%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.6\nbillion; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $146 million based on a 13% effective tax rate. Diluted share count is\nexpected to be approximately 1.62 billion shares. For the full year of 2023, we are not providing specific guidance due to the uncertainty in the\nmacro environment. However, let me provide some color.\nDirectionally, we expect Embedded and Data Center annual revenue to grow from 2022 based on the strength of our product portfolio and expected\nshare gains. In addition, we expect Client and the Gaming segment revenue to decline based on the current demand environment. We expectnon-GAAP gross margin to be approximately flattish in the first half and the expansion in the second half of the year. We expect to manage quarterly\nnon-GAAP operating expenses flat with the fourth quarter until we see the demand environment improves. For modeling purpose, we expect\nnon-GAAP effective tax rate for the year to be 13% and the diluted share count to be approximately 1.62 billion shares.\nIn closing, we had a strong year with record revenue and profitability, driven by our leadership in product portfolio and the diversification of our\nbusiness. Looking forward to 2023, as Lisa mentioned earlier, we'll continue to focus on executing our long-term growth strategy while driving",

Net income\nwas $1.1 billion flat year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.92 per share a year ago, primarily due to lower client\noperating income.\nNow turning to our reportable segment for the fourth quarter. Starting with the Data Center segment. Revenue was $1.7 billion, up 42% year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by strong growth in third-generation EPYC server processor revenue and the early ramp of fourth-generation EPYC processors.Data center operating income was $444 million or 27% of revenue compared to $369 million or 32% a year ago. Higher operating income was\ndriven primarily by stronger revenue, partially offset by higher R&D investment to support the top line revenue growth.\nClient segment revenue was $903 million, down 51% year-over-year due to reduced processor shipments resulting from a weak PC market and\nsignificant inventory correction across the PC supply chain. Client operating loss was $152 million compared to operating income of $530 million\na year ago or 29% of revenue, primarily due to lower revenue.\nGaming segment revenue was $1.6 billion, down 7% year-over-year due to lower gaming graphics revenue, partially offset by higher semi-customerproduct sales. Gaming operating income was $266 million or 16% of revenue compared to $407 million or 23% a year ago. The decrease was\nprimarily due to lower graphics revenue.\nEmbedded segment revenue was $1.4 billion, up $1.3 billion from a year ago, primarily due to the inclusion of Xilinx Embedded revenue.

We have a strong balance sheet with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment of $5.9 billion at the end of\nthe fourth quarter. During the quarter, we returned $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases. In 2022, we returned a total of $3.7\nbillion to shareholders which was 119% of free cash flow. We have $6.5 billion in remaining authorization to share repurchases. Free cash flow was\n$443 million compared to $736 million in the same quarter last year.\nFree cash flow decreased primarily due to higher inventory. Inventory was $3.8 billion, up approximately $402 million from the prior quarter,\nprimarily driven by the inventory increase in advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products.Now let me turn to our full year financial results. 2022 revenue was $23.6 billion, up 44% year-over-year, driven by increased Embedded, Data\nCenter and the Gaming segment revenue, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. On our combined AMD and Xilinx company basis, 2022\npro forma revenue was $24.1 billion, up 20% compared to $20.1 billion in 2021. Gross margin was 52%, up 370 basis points from the prior year,\nprimarily driven by richer product mix with higher revenue from Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment\nrevenue.\nOperating expenses were 26% of revenue compared to 24% in 2021. 2022 operating income was $6.3 billion, up $2.3 billion, an increase of 56%\nfrom a year ago resulting in operating margin of 27% compared to 25% in 2021, primarily driven by higher revenue and gross margin expansion.\nNet income was $5.5 billion compared to $3.4 billion, up 60% from the prior year. Earnings per share was $3.50 compared to $2.79 for the prior\nyear, primarily due to Data Center growth and addition of Xilinx.\nFull year free cash flow was $3.1 billion, resulting free cash flow margin of 13% for the year.

See Cautionary Statement on\nSlide 2. These forward-looking outlook statements and non-GAAP measures are based on current expectations as of January 31, 2023, and assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks anduncertainties. AMD undertakes no intent or obligation to publicly update or revise its outlook statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\nAll items, except revenue, are on a non-GAAP basis. Adjustments to arrive at the GAAP financial outlook typically include stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, income\ntax provision, equity income in investee, and other non- recurring items such as loss on debt redemption/conversion, impairment charges and acquisition-related costs. The timing and impact of such\nadjustments are dependent on future events that are typically uncertain or outside of AMD's control, therefore, a reconciliation to equivalent GAAP measures is not practicable at this time. 2.

See Cautionary Statement on\nSlide 2. These forward-looking outlook statements and non-GAAP measures are based on current expectations as of January 31, 2023, and assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks anduncertainties. AMD undertakes no intent or obligation to publicly update or revise its outlook statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\nAll items, except revenue, are on a non-GAAP basis. Adjustments to arrive at the GAAP financial outlook typically include stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, income\ntax provision, equity income in investee, and other non- recurring items such as loss on debt redemption/conversion, impairment charges and acquisition-related costs. The timing and impact of such\nadjustments are dependent on future events that are typically uncertain or outside of AMD's control, therefore, a reconciliation to equivalent GAAP measures is not practicable at this time. 2.

          "content": "Jean X. Hu  - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. 2022 was a very strong year for AMD. We had a record revenue, gross margin, profitability, and we\ngenerated significant free cash flow. The year was also highlighted by our strategic acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando, expanding and diversifying\nour business portfolio.\nFourth quarter 2022 revenue for $5.6 billion was up 16% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue in the Embedded and Data Center segment,\npartially offset by lower Client and the Gaming segment revenue. Gross margin was 51%, up 70 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by\nricher product mix with higher revenue in Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. Operatingexpenses were $1.6 billion compared to $1.1 billion a year ago, driven by the inclusion of Xilinx OpEx and additional R&D and go-to-market\ninvestments to support the next phase of our revenue growth.\nOperating income declined $66 million from a year ago to $1.3 billion, and the operating margin was 23%, down from 27% a year ago. Net income\nwas $1.1 billion flat year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.92 per share a year ago, primarily due to lower client\noperating income.\nNow turning to our reportable segment for the fourth quarter. Starting with the Data Center segment. Revenue was $1.7 billion, up 42% year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by strong growth in third-generation EPYC server processor revenue and the early ramp of fourth-generation EPYC processors.Data center operating income was $444 million or 27% of revenue compared to $369 million or 32% a year ago. Higher operating income was\ndriven primarily by stronger revenue, partially offset by higher R&D investment to support the top line revenue growth.\nClient segment revenue was $903 million, down 51% year-over-year due to reduced processor shipments resulting from a weak PC market and\nsignificant inventory correction across the PC supply chain. Client operating loss was $152 million compared to operating income of $530 million\na year ago or 29% of revenue, primarily due to lower revenue.\nGaming segment revenue was $1.6 billion, down 7% year-over-year due to lower gaming graphics revenue, partially offset by higher semi-customerproduct sales. Gaming operating income was $266 million or 16% of revenue compared to $407 million or 23% a year ago. The decrease was\nprimarily due to lower graphics revenue.\nEmbedded segment revenue was $1.4 billion, up $1.3 billion from a year ago, primarily due to the inclusion of Xilinx Embedded revenue. Embedded\noperating income was $699 million or 50% of revenue compared to $18 million or 25% a year ago, primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx.\n5\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com  | Contact Us\n©2023 Refinitiv.

We have a strong balance sheet with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment of $5.9 billion at the end of\nthe fourth quarter. During the quarter, we returned $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases. In 2022, we returned a total of $3.7\nbillion to shareholders which was 119% of free cash flow. We have $6.5 billion in remaining authorization to share repurchases. Free cash flow was\n$443 million compared to $736 million in the same quarter last year.\nFree cash flow decreased primarily due to higher inventory. Inventory was $3.8 billion, up approximately $402 million from the prior quarter,\nprimarily driven by the inventory increase in advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products.Now let me turn to our full year financial results. 2022 revenue was $23.6 billion, up 44% year-over-year, driven by increased Embedded, Data\nCenter and the Gaming segment revenue, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. On our combined AMD and Xilinx company basis, 2022\npro forma revenue was $24.1 billion, up 20% compared to $20.1 billion in 2021. Gross margin was 52%, up 370 basis points from the prior year,\nprimarily driven by richer product mix with higher revenue from Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment\nrevenue.\nOperating expenses were 26% of revenue compared to 24% in 2021. 2022 operating income was $6.3 billion, up $2.3 billion, an increase of 56%\nfrom a year ago resulting in operating margin of 27% compared to 25% in 2021, primarily driven by higher revenue and gross margin expansion.\nNet income was $5.5 billion compared to $3.4 billion, up 60% from the prior year. Earnings per share was $3.50 compared to $2.79 for the prior\nyear, primarily due to Data Center growth and addition of Xilinx.\nFull year free cash flow was $3.1 billion, resulting free cash flow margin of 13% for the year. We invested approximately $1 billion in long-term\nsupply chain capacity in 2022 to support our expectations for future revenue growth and increase market share.Let me now turn to our financial outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current macro environment. For\nthe first quarter of 2023, we expect revenue to be approximately $5.3 billion, plus or minus $300 million, a decrease of approximately 10%\nyear-over-year and 5% sequentially. Year-over-year Data Center and Embedded segment revenue are expected to grow, offset by lower Client and\nGaming segment revenue. Sequentially, Embedded segment revenue is expected to increase. Client and Gaming segment revenue are expected\nto decline largely consistent with seasonality. Data Center segment revenue is expected to decline due to elevated levels of inventory with some\ncloud customers.",

Can you give us a sense about roughly how far under\nconsumption, you believe, you're shipping on the PC side, either in Q4 and Q1?\nAnd Lisa, correct me if I'm wrong, I thought I heard you say in an answer to an earlier question that you expect the PC client just to\ngrow into second quarter. So does that suggest that 1Q, you think, is the bottom on the PC? And then I had a follow-up.\nLisa Su  - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Chair of the Board\nSure, Mark. So we -- so the first -- the second question, yes. We do believe the first quarter is the bottom for our PC market -- for our\nPC business, and we'll see some growth in the second quarter and then a seasonally higher second half.\nIn terms of the under shipment, I mean, I think we're -- we under-shipped in Q3, we under-shipped in Q4. We will under-ship, to a\nlesser extent, in Q1. So I think you can infer that from our guidance of single-digit down. And then we'll be back to a more normal\nenvironment.\nNow just as a reminder, though, the first half is not usually a -- the first half is usually a seasonally weak client time anyways. So we\nwould expect more lift in the second half, not so much in the second quarter.\nMark John Lipacis  - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research AnalystGot you. Okay. That's very helpful. And then a follow-up, if I may, on the -- China is lifting, as they're lifting the COVID restrictions, I\nguess I would imagine that you would expect that ultimately, at some point, to translate into higher demand. And I'm wondering if\nyou could just kind of share with us your thoughts about how that might play out. And could you remind us, to the extent that you\ncan help us understand the risk to the supply side for you in the event that the COVID spreads rapidly as they lift the restrictions and\nimpacts what you have on the supply side there.\nLisa Su  - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Chair of the Board\nSure, Mark. So we've done a very good job in our supply chain in terms of risk mitigation. So we have -- we don't believe that wehave a significant risk as it relates to COVID future outbreaks, if there are any. As it relates to China recovery, I think we would benefit\nfrom a China recovery. It's very difficult to call. I mean we've seen, certainly in our Data Center business, we saw in the second half\nof the year and last year in the first half of this year that the China Data Center business has been weak for us. If there was a recovery,\nI think we would benefit from that. Similarly, some of the other consumer patterns as well. But it's very difficult to call. So we put\nthat in the bucket of macro uncertainty, and we'll see how it plays out.\nRuth Cotter  - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP of Marketing, HR & IR\nOperator, we'll take 2 more questions from 2 callers, please.\nOperatorCertainly.

Congrats on being the first all-female CEO, CFO team. It's a long time coming. So your gross margins held up pretty well forthe Q1 guide despite high-margin Data Center business going down. So if the Data Center business remains weak and has a rough\nquarter in Q2, can we expect a similar gross margin resiliency?\nJean X. Hu  - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO\nYes, definitely. I think as I said earlier, the major impact on gross margin actually is the PC Client side. The stabilization and the\nbottoming of Client on the business really help us with the gross margin at the current level. Second half, we should see the expansion\nof gross margin.\nChristopher Brett Danely  - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD & Analyst\nSure.

Before discussing our financial results, I wanted to make a few comments about\nour CFO transition. I'd like to start by thanking Devinder for all of his contributions to AMD over the last 39 years. During his tenure as CFO, we built\na strong financial foundation that has enabled AMD's significant growth and success. On a personal note, his partnership and expertise have been\ninvaluable to me. I know I speak for all of AMD when I say we appreciate all he has done for the company and wish him the best in his upcoming\nretirement.I also want to welcome our new EVP and CFO, Jean Hu, to our first AMD earnings call since joining us earlier this month. Jean's more than 14 years\nof public company CFO experience and proven track record of financial leadership make her an excellent addition to our team. I look forward to\nworking closely with her as we continue to transform and scale our business.\nNow turning to the business results. 2022 was a strong year for AMD as we navigated the challenging macro environment to deliver best-in-class\ngrowth and record profitability driven by our Embedded and Data Center segments.

Intel’s market share, margins\nand significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel\npartners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the\npast resulted in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and adversely affected our\nmargins and profitability.\nIntel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brandand other marketing programs. As a result of Intel’s position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86\nmicroprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor\nmarket requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips,\nnetworking devices (wired and wireless), non-volatile storage and other components necessary to assemble a computer\nsystem. OEMs that purchase microprocessors for computer systems are highly dependent on Intel, which can make them less\ninnovative on their own and, to a large extent, can become distributors of Intel technology. Additionally, Intel is able to drivede facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed\naccess to such standards.\nAs long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intel’s: business\npractices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions which may limit our market share and margins;\nproduct mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; exclusivity payments to\nits current and potential customers, retailers and channel partners that require or result in exclusive product arrangements; de\nfacto control over industry standards, and heavy influence on PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including",

          "content": "Competition in the Computing and Graphics Segment\nThe markets in which we participate are highly competitive. Our primary competitor in the supply of\nmicroprocessors is Intel Corporation (Intel). A variety of companies provide or have developed ARM-based\nmicroprocessors and platforms. ARM-based designs are being used in the PC market, which could lead to further\ngrowth and development of the ARM ecosystem. In 2020, NVIDIA Corporation (NVIDIA), our principal competitor\nin the discrete graphics market, announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire ARM Holdings. Our\nability to compete with companies who use ARM-based solutions depends on our ability to timely design and\nbring to market energy-efficient, high-performing products at an attractive price point.In the graphics market, our principal competitor in the supply of discrete graphics is NVIDIA who is the market\nshare leader. Intel also manufactures and sells embedded graphics processors and integrated graphics\nprocessor (IGP) chipsets and is a dominant competitor with respect to this portion of our business. Also, Intel has\ndeveloped their own high-end discrete GPUs and has announced that they have developed gaming-focused\ndiscrete graphics that will release in 2022. Other competitors include suppliers of discrete graphics, embedded\ngraphics processors and integrated graphics processor (IGP) chipsets. Some of our competitors are smaller\ncompanies, which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs, but less financial resources to doso. We believe that the growing complexity of graphics processors and the associated research and development\ncosts represent a high and growing barrier to entry in this market. With respect to integrated graphics, higher unit\nshipments of our APUs and Intel’s integrated graphics may drive computer manufacturers to reduce the number\nof systems they build paired with discrete graphics components, particularly for notebooks, because they may\noffer satisfactory graphics performance for most mainstream PC users at a lower cost. For GPU data center\nproducts, our principal competitor is NVIDIA, which established its market share in HPC and machine learning\nthrough its CUDA software platform. Another competitor, Intel, builds products for acceleration in the data center,\nsuch as Intel Xe or Habana AI processors. Other competitors include numerous deep learning accelerator\ncompanies, consisting mostly of early to late stage start-ups. Large cloud service providers have also shown\ninterest in building their own products to accelerate AI.",

Revenue increased 42% year-over-year to $1.7 billion, led\nby increased adoption of our EPYC processors by cloud providers. In cloud, sales to North American hyperscalers more than doubled year-over-year\nas hyperscale customers continued moving more of their internal workloads and external instances to EPYC processors. EPYC processors now\npower more than 600 publicly available instances globally following the launches of new AMD-based instances from AWS, Microsoft and others\nin the quarter.\nIn Enterprise, revenue declined year-over-year as demand slowed based on the macro environment. Against this backdrop, we continue expandingour pipeline and closed a number of new wins in the fourth quarter with Fortune 500 financial services, automotive, technology, energy and\naerospace companies. In HPC, growing EPYC processor adoption was highlighted by the number of AMD-powered supercomputers on the latest\ntop 500 list increasing by 38% year-over-year. AMD now powers more than 100 of the world's fastest supercomputers and 15 of the top 20 most\nenergy-efficient supercomputers in the world.\nTo build our Data Center leadership, we launched our fourth gen EPYC processors this past November that deliver up to 2x faster performance in\ncloud, enterprise and HPC applications, and are up to 80% more energy efficient than the competition's most recently announced offerings. Weare seeing very strong customer pull for fourth-gen EPYC CPUs, which complement our third-gen offerings with additional performance and\ncapabilities.\nInitial cloud deployments are going very well, and we expect to ramp both internal workloads and public instances throughout 2023.\nFor Enterprise, there are more than 140 fourth-gen EPYC platforms in development from HPE, Dell, Lenovo, Supermicro and others, an increase of\n40% compared to the prior generation.\nNow looking at our broader Data Center portfolio. We had record sales of our Xilinx Data Center and networking products in the quarter, led by\nstrong demand from financial services companies for our newly launched Alveo X3 series boards, optimized for low latency trading. Sales of ourPensando DPUs also ramped significantly from the prior quarter, driven by supply chain improvements and continued demand.

Intel’s market share, margins\nand significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel\npartners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the\npast and are likely in the future to result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and\nadversely affect our margins and profitability.Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand\nand other marketing programs. As a result of Intel’s position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86\nmicroprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor\nmarket requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips,\nmotherboards and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto\nstandards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such\nstandards.Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on\nmarketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to maintain its market position and to continue to\ninvest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the\nextent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process\ntechnologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intel’s\naggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products. For example, Intel has introduced microprocessors\nfor low-cost notebooks, similar to products that we offer for low-cost notebooksAs long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intel’s:\n• business practices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market\nshare and margins;\n• product mix and introduction schedules;\n• product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies;\n• exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers and channel partners;\n• de facto control over industry standards, and heavy influence on PC manufacturers and other PC industry\nparticipants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system, or BIOS, suppliers and\nsoftware companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and39November 2, 2017 - 10-Q: Quarterly report pursuant to Section 13 or ... https://ir.amd.com/financial-information/sec-filings/content/0000002...\n61 von 90 20.10.2025, 13:17\nNovember 2, 2017 - 10-Q: Quarterly report pursuant to Section 13 or ... https://ir.amd.com/financial-information/sec-filings/content/0000002...\n62 von 90 20.10.2025, 13:17\n• marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its original\nequipment manufacturer OEM customers.\nIntel could also take actions that place our discrete GPUs at a competitive disadvantage, including giving one or more\nof our competitors in the graphics market, such as Nvidia Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics",
