See Cautionary Statement on\nSlide 2. These forward-looking outlook statements and non-GAAP measures are based on current expectations as of January 31, 2023, and assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks anduncertainties. AMD undertakes no intent or obligation to publicly update or revise its outlook statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\nAll items, except revenue, are on a non-GAAP basis. Adjustments to arrive at the GAAP financial outlook typically include stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, income\ntax provision, equity income in investee, and other non- recurring items such as loss on debt redemption/conversion, impairment charges and acquisition-related costs. The timing and impact of such\nadjustments are dependent on future events that are typically uncertain or outside of AMD's control, therefore, a reconciliation to equivalent GAAP measures is not practicable at this time. 2.

Gross margin was 51%, up 70 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by\nricher product mix with higher revenue in Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue.

Net income\nwas $1.1 billion flat year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.92 per share a year ago, primarily due to lower client\noperating income.\nNow turning to our reportable segment for the fourth quarter. Starting with the Data Center segment. Revenue was $1.7 billion, up 42% year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by strong growth in third-generation EPYC server processor revenue and the early ramp of fourth-generation EPYC processors.Data center operating income was $444 million or 27% of revenue compared to $369 million or 32% a year ago. Higher operating income was\ndriven primarily by stronger revenue, partially offset by higher R&D investment to support the top line revenue growth.\nClient segment revenue was $903 million, down 51% year-over-year due to reduced processor shipments resulting from a weak PC market and\nsignificant inventory correction across the PC supply chain. Client operating loss was $152 million compared to operating income of $530 million\na year ago or 29% of revenue, primarily due to lower revenue.\nGaming segment revenue was $1.6 billion, down 7% year-over-year due to lower gaming graphics revenue, partially offset by higher semi-customerproduct sales. Gaming operating income was $266 million or 16% of revenue compared to $407 million or 23% a year ago. The decrease was\nprimarily due to lower graphics revenue.\nEmbedded segment revenue was $1.4 billion, up $1.3 billion from a year ago, primarily due to the inclusion of Xilinx Embedded revenue. Embedded\noperating income was $699 million or 50% of revenue compared to $18 million or 25% a year ago, primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx.\n5\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2023 Refinitiv.

We have a strong balance sheet with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment of $5.9 billion at the end of\nthe fourth quarter. During the quarter, we returned $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases. In 2022, we returned a total of $3.7\nbillion to shareholders which was 119% of free cash flow. We have $6.5 billion in remaining authorization to share repurchases. Free cash flow was\n$443 million compared to $736 million in the same quarter last year.\nFree cash flow decreased primarily due to higher inventory. Inventory was $3.8 billion, up approximately $402 million from the prior quarter,\nprimarily driven by the inventory increase in advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products.Now let me turn to our full year financial results. 2022 revenue was $23.6 billion, up 44% year-over-year, driven by increased Embedded, Data\nCenter and the Gaming segment revenue, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. On our combined AMD and Xilinx company basis, 2022\npro forma revenue was $24.1 billion, up 20% compared to $20.1 billion in 2021. Gross margin was 52%, up 370 basis points from the prior year,\nprimarily driven by richer product mix with higher revenue from Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment\nrevenue.\nOperating expenses were 26% of revenue compared to 24% in 2021. 2022 operating income was $6.3 billion, up $2.3 billion, an increase of 56%\nfrom a year ago resulting in operating margin of 27% compared to 25% in 2021, primarily driven by higher revenue and gross margin expansion.\nNet income was $5.5 billion compared to $3.4 billion, up 60% from the prior year. Earnings per share was $3.50 compared to $2.79 for the prior\nyear, primarily due to Data Center growth and addition of Xilinx.\nFull year free cash flow was $3.1 billion, resulting free cash flow margin of 13% for the year. We invested approximately $1 billion in long-term\nsupply chain capacity in 2022 to support our expectations for future revenue growth and increase market share."

We expect AI adoption will accelerate significantly over the coming years and are incredibly excited about leveraging our\nbroad portfolio of CPUs, GPUs and adaptive accelerators in combination with our software expertise to deliver differentiated solutions that can\naddress the full spectrum of AI needs in training and inference across cloud, edge and client.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year financial results. Jean?Jean X. Hu - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. 2022 was a very strong year for AMD. We had a record revenue, gross margin, profitability, and we\ngenerated significant free cash flow. The year was also highlighted by our strategic acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando, expanding and diversifying\nour business portfolio.\nFourth quarter 2022 revenue for $5.6 billion was up 16% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue in the Embedded and Data Center segment,\npartially offset by lower Client and the Gaming segment revenue. Gross margin was 51%, up 70 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by\nricher product mix with higher revenue in Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. Operatingexpenses were $1.6 billion compared to $1.1 billion a year ago, driven by the inclusion of Xilinx OpEx and additional R&D and go-to-market\ninvestments to support the next phase of our revenue growth.\nOperating income declined $66 million from a year ago to $1.3 billion, and the operating margin was 23%, down from 27% a year ago. Net income\nwas $1.1 billion flat year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.92 per share a year ago, primarily due to lower client\noperating income.\nNow turning to our reportable segment for the fourth quarter. Starting with the Data Center segment. Revenue was $1.7 billion, up 42% year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by strong growth in third-generation EPYC server processor revenue and the early ramp of fourth-generation EPYC processors.Data center operating income was $444 million or 27% of revenue compared to $369 million or 32% a year ago. Higher operating income was\ndriven primarily by stronger revenue, partially offset by higher R&D investment to support the top line revenue growth.\nClient segment revenue was $903 million, down 51% year-over-year due to reduced processor shipments resulting from a weak PC market and\nsignificant inventory correction across the PC supply chain. Client operating loss was $152 million compared to operating income of $530 million\na year ago or 29% of revenue, primarily due to lower revenue.\nGaming segment revenue was $1.6 billion, down 7% year-over-year due to lower gaming graphics revenue, partially offset by higher semi-customerproduct sales. Gaming operating income was $266 million or 16% of revenue compared to $407 million or 23% a year ago. The decrease was\nprimarily due to lower graphics revenue.\nEmbedded segment revenue was $1.4 billion, up $1.3 billion from a year ago, primarily due to the inclusion of Xilinx Embedded revenue. Embedded\noperating income was $699 million or 50% of revenue compared to $18 million or 25% a year ago, primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx.\n5\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2023 Refinitiv.

We have a strong balance sheet with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment of $5.9 billion at the end of\nthe fourth quarter. During the quarter, we returned $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases. In 2022, we returned a total of $3.7\nbillion to shareholders which was 119% of free cash flow. We have $6.5 billion in remaining authorization to share repurchases. Free cash flow was\n$443 million compared to $736 million in the same quarter last year.\nFree cash flow decreased primarily due to higher inventory. Inventory was $3.8 billion, up approximately $402 million from the prior quarter,\nprimarily driven by the inventory increase in advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products.Now let me turn to our full year financial results. 2022 revenue was $23.6 billion, up 44% year-over-year, driven by increased Embedded, Data\nCenter and the Gaming segment revenue, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. On our combined AMD and Xilinx company basis, 2022\npro forma revenue was $24.1 billion, up 20% compared to $20.1 billion in 2021. Gross margin was 52%, up 370 basis points from the prior year,\nprimarily driven by richer product mix with higher revenue from Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment\nrevenue.\nOperating expenses were 26% of revenue compared to 24% in 2021. 2022 operating income was $6.3 billion, up $2.3 billion, an increase of 56%\nfrom a year ago resulting in operating margin of 27% compared to 25% in 2021, primarily driven by higher revenue and gross margin expansion.\nNet income was $5.5 billion compared to $3.4 billion, up 60% from the prior year. Earnings per share was $3.50 compared to $2.79 for the prior\nyear, primarily due to Data Center growth and addition of Xilinx.\nFull year free cash flow was $3.1 billion, resulting free cash flow margin of 13% for the year. We invested approximately $1 billion in long-term\nsupply chain capacity in 2022 to support our expectations for future revenue growth and increase market share.Let me now turn to our financial outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current macro environment. For\nthe first quarter of 2023, we expect revenue to be approximately $5.3 billion, plus or minus $300 million, a decrease of approximately 10%\nyear-over-year and 5% sequentially. Year-over-year Data Center and Embedded segment revenue are expected to grow, offset by lower Client and\nGaming segment revenue. Sequentially, Embedded segment revenue is expected to increase. Client and Gaming segment revenue are expected\nto decline largely consistent with seasonality. Data Center segment revenue is expected to decline due to elevated levels of inventory with some\ncloud customers.In addition, for Q1 2023, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 50%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.6\nbillion; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $146 million based on a 13% effective tax rate. Diluted share count is\nexpected to be approximately 1.62 billion shares. For the full year of 2023, we are not providing specific guidance due to the uncertainty in the\nmacro environment. However, let me provide some color.\nDirectionally, we expect Embedded and Data Center annual revenue to grow from 2022 based on the strength of our product portfolio and expected\nshare gains. In addition, we expect Client and the Gaming segment revenue to decline based on the current demand environment. We expectnon-GAAP gross margin to be approximately flattish in the first half and the expansion in the second half of the year. We expect to manage quarterly\nnon-GAAP operating expenses flat with the fourth quarter until we see the demand environment improves. For modeling purpose, we expect\nnon-GAAP effective tax rate for the year to be 13% and the diluted share count to be approximately 1.62 billion shares.\nIn closing, we had a strong year with record revenue and profitability, driven by our leadership in product portfolio and the diversification of our\nbusiness. Looking forward to 2023, as Lisa mentioned earlier, we'll continue to focus on executing our long-term growth strategy while driving"

Fourth quarter revenue increased 16% year-over-year to $5.6 billion, driven by significant growth in our Embedded\nand Data Center segments, which accounted for more than 50% of overall revenue in the quarter. On a full year basis, we grew annual revenue\n44% to $23.6 billion. We set annual records for revenue, gross margin and profitability driven largely by a 64% increase in our Data Center segment\nrevenue and the strong performance of our Embedded segment following our Xilinx acquisition.Turning to the fourth quarter business results, starting with our Data Center segment. Revenue increased 42% year-over-year to $1.7 billion, led\nby increased adoption of our EPYC processors by cloud providers. In cloud, sales to North American hyperscalers more than doubled year-over-year\nas hyperscale customers continued moving more of their internal workloads and external instances to EPYC processors. EPYC processors now\npower more than 600 publicly available instances globally following the launches of new AMD-based instances from AWS, Microsoft and others\nin the quarter.\nIn Enterprise, revenue declined year-over-year as demand slowed based on the macro environment. Against this backdrop, we continue expandingour pipeline and closed a number of new wins in the fourth quarter with Fortune 500 financial services, automotive, technology, energy and\naerospace companies. In HPC, growing EPYC processor adoption was highlighted by the number of AMD-powered supercomputers on the latest\ntop 500 list increasing by 38% year-over-year. AMD now powers more than 100 of the world's fastest supercomputers and 15 of the top 20 most\nenergy-efficient supercomputers in the world.\nTo build our Data Center leadership, we launched our fourth gen EPYC processors this past November that deliver up to 2x faster performance in\ncloud, enterprise and HPC applications, and are up to 80% more energy efficient than the competition's most recently announced offerings. Weare seeing very strong customer pull for fourth-gen EPYC CPUs, which complement our third-gen offerings with additional performance and\ncapabilities.\nInitial cloud deployments are going very well, and we expect to ramp both internal workloads and public instances throughout 2023.\nFor Enterprise, there are more than 140 fourth-gen EPYC platforms in development from HPE, Dell, Lenovo, Supermicro and others, an increase of\n40% compared to the prior generation.\nNow looking at our broader Data Center portfolio. We had record sales of our Xilinx Data Center and networking products in the quarter, led by\nstrong demand from financial services companies for our newly launched Alveo X3 series boards, optimized for low latency trading. Sales of ourPensando DPUs also ramped significantly from the prior quarter, driven by supply chain improvements and continued demand. We are very pleased\n3\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2023 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

In January, we previewed our next-generation MI300 accelerator that will be used for large model AI applications\nin cloud data centers and has been selected to power the 2-plus exaflop El Capitan exascale supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National\nLaboratories. MI300 will be the industry's first data center chip that combines a CPU, GPU and memory into a single integrated design, delivering\n8x more performance and 5x better efficiency for HPC and AI workloads, compared to our MI250 accelerator currently powering the world's fastest\nsuper computer. MI300 is on track to begin sampling to lead customers later this quarter and launch in the second half of 2023.Turning to our Client segment. Revenue declined 51% year-over-year to $903 million. We continue to ship below PC consumption in the fourth\nquarter as we focused on further reducing downstream inventory. While overall PC demand remains soft, desktop channel sell-through increased\nsequentially during the holiday season. We launched our latest generation Ryzen 7000 series notebook processors earlier in January, including our\nRyzen 7040 CPU series that deliver leadership performance in battery life and are our first processors to feature Ryzen AI, the industry's only dedicated\non-chip AI inference engine in an x86 processor. Ryzen AI is powered by the highly scalable XDNA architecture, which is the first integration of\nAMD and Xilinx IP, less than a year after closing the acquisition.\nWe also launched our Ryzen 7045 series CPUs, our first mobile processor based on a chiplet design that delivers significantly higher performance\nthan the competition in gaming and content creation applications. We have more than 250 ultrathin gaming and commercial notebook design\nwins, spanning our full family of Ryzen 7000 series processors on track to launch this year, an increase of 25% year-over-year with the first notebooks\nplanned to go on sale in February.Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 7% year-over-year to $1.6 billion as lower gaming graphics sales more than offset higher\nsemi-custom revenue. Semi-custom SoC revenue grew year-over-year as demand for game consoles remained strong during the holidays. Gaming\ngraphics revenue declined year-over-year as we further reduced desktop GPU downstream channel inventory. Channel sell-through of our Radeon\nRX GPUs increased sequentially, and we launched our high-end Radeon 7900 series GPUs to strong demand based on the performance of our new\nRDNA 3 architecture and 5-nanometer chiplet design.\nIn January, we announced our first RDNA 3 mobile GPUs that have been selected to power new gaming notebooks from Dell, Alienware, ASUS and\nothers that are on track to begin shipping in the first half of 2023.Looking at our Embedded segment. Revenue increased significantly year-over-year to a record $1.4 billion. We had record sales across a number\nof our Embedded markets, including communications, automotive, industrial and health care, aerospace and defense, and test and emulation. In\ncommunications, we saw particular strength with expanded 5G wireless installations in India and ongoing wired infrastructure deployments with\nTier 1 communications providers. Automotive growth was driven by the ramps of new Ford camera, 4D radar and infotainment wins across multiple\ncustomers. We recently announced multiple new wins for our automotive grade Zynq UltraScale+ platforms with some of the largest vehicleequipment suppliers including Aisin next-generation Automated Parking Assist system and DENSO's next-generation LiDAR platform that can\nimprove the resolution required for autonomous driving and other industrial machine vision applications by 20x.\nWe also continued to see strong growth with industrial and health care, aerospace and defense and tested and emulation customers in the quarter,\ndriven by SAM expansion for our leadership-adaptive SoCs, new design win ramps and increased supply across multiple nodes.\nTaking a step back, as we approach the 1-year anniversary of the closing of our Xilinx acquisition next month, the integration has gone extremely\nwell, and our Embedded business has become a major growth driver for AMD, strengthening our financial model and significantly diversifying our\nbusiness. In addition, we are seeing substantial new revenue synergy opportunities as we combine Xilinx's industry-leading adaptive products and\n6,000-plus customers with AMD's expanded breadth of compute products and scale."

Automotive growth was driven by the ramps of new Ford camera, 4D radar and infotainment wins across multiple\ncustomers. We recently announced multiple new wins for our automotive grade Zynq UltraScale+ platforms with some of the largest vehicleequipment suppliers including Aisin next-generation Automated Parking Assist system and DENSO's next-generation LiDAR platform that can\nimprove the resolution required for autonomous driving and other industrial machine vision applications by 20x.\nWe also continued to see strong growth with industrial and health care, aerospace and defense and tested and emulation customers in the quarter,\ndriven by SAM expansion for our leadership-adaptive SoCs, new design win ramps and increased supply across multiple nodes.\nTaking a step back, as we approach the 1-year anniversary of the closing of our Xilinx acquisition next month, the integration has gone extremely\nwell, and our Embedded business has become a major growth driver for AMD, strengthening our financial model and significantly diversifying our\nbusiness. In addition, we are seeing substantial new revenue synergy opportunities as we combine Xilinx's industry-leading adaptive products and\n6,000-plus customers with AMD's expanded breadth of compute products and scale.In summary, overall, 2022 was a strong year for AMD despite the weak PC market. We significantly grew our Data Center, Embedded and Gaming\nbusinesses and executed well across our product portfolio. As we enter 2023, we expect the overall demand environment to remain mixed with\n4\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2023 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

In the PC market, we are planning for the PC TAM to be down approximately 10% for 2023. We expect\nto continue to ship below consumption in the first quarter to reduce downstream inventory, which is reflected in our guidance.\nIn our Embedded and Data Center segments, we believe we are well positioned to grow revenue and gain share in 2023 based on the strength of\nour competitive positioning and leadership high-performance and adaptive product portfolio. We do see elevated levels of inventory with some\ncloud customers, which will lead to a softer first half and a stronger second half of the year. We continue working very closely with our customersto navigate the dynamic market conditions while also making the right strategic investments to exit the current cycle with an even stronger and\nmore differentiated set of products to drive future growth.\nOver the next several years, one of our largest growth opportunities is in AI, which is in the early stages of transforming virtually every industry\nservice and product. We expect AI adoption will accelerate significantly over the coming years and are incredibly excited about leveraging our\nbroad portfolio of CPUs, GPUs and adaptive accelerators in combination with our software expertise to deliver differentiated solutions that can\naddress the full spectrum of AI needs in training and inference across cloud, edge and client.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year financial results. Jean?Jean X. Hu - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. 2022 was a very strong year for AMD. We had a record revenue, gross margin, profitability, and we\ngenerated significant free cash flow. The year was also highlighted by our strategic acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando, expanding and diversifying\nour business portfolio.\nFourth quarter 2022 revenue for $5.6 billion was up 16% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue in the Embedded and Data Center segment,\npartially offset by lower Client and the Gaming segment revenue. Gross margin was 51%, up 70 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by\nricher product mix with higher revenue in Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. Operatingexpenses were $1.6 billion compared to $1.1 billion a year ago, driven by the inclusion of Xilinx OpEx and additional R&D and go-to-market\ninvestments to support the next phase of our revenue growth.\nOperating income declined $66 million from a year ago to $1.3 billion, and the operating margin was 23%, down from 27% a year ago. Net income\nwas $1.1 billion flat year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.92 per share a year ago, primarily due to lower client\noperating income.\nNow turning to our reportable segment for the fourth quarter. Starting with the Data Center segment. Revenue was $1.7 billion, up 42% year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by strong growth in third-generation EPYC server processor revenue and the early ramp of fourth-generation EPYC processors.Data center operating income was $444 million or 27% of revenue compared to $369 million or 32% a year ago. Higher operating income was\ndriven primarily by stronger revenue, partially offset by higher R&D investment to support the top line revenue growth.\nClient segment revenue was $903 million, down 51% year-over-year due to reduced processor shipments resulting from a weak PC market and\nsignificant inventory correction across the PC supply chain. Client operating loss was $152 million compared to operating income of $530 million\na year ago or 29% of revenue, primarily due to lower revenue.\nGaming segment revenue was $1.6 billion, down 7% year-over-year due to lower gaming graphics revenue, partially offset by higher semi-customerproduct sales. Gaming operating income was $266 million or 16% of revenue compared to $407 million or 23% a year ago. The decrease was\nprimarily due to lower graphics revenue.\nEmbedded segment revenue was $1.4 billion, up $1.3 billion from a year ago, primarily due to the inclusion of Xilinx Embedded revenue. Embedded\noperating income was $699 million or 50% of revenue compared to $18 million or 25% a year ago, primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx.\n5\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2023 Refinitiv.

We have a strong balance sheet with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment of $5.9 billion at the end of\nthe fourth quarter. During the quarter, we returned $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases. In 2022, we returned a total of $3.7\nbillion to shareholders which was 119% of free cash flow. We have $6.5 billion in remaining authorization to share repurchases. Free cash flow was\n$443 million compared to $736 million in the same quarter last year.\nFree cash flow decreased primarily due to higher inventory. Inventory was $3.8 billion, up approximately $402 million from the prior quarter,\nprimarily driven by the inventory increase in advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products.Now let me turn to our full year financial results. 2022 revenue was $23.6 billion, up 44% year-over-year, driven by increased Embedded, Data\nCenter and the Gaming segment revenue, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. On our combined AMD and Xilinx company basis, 2022\npro forma revenue was $24.1 billion, up 20% compared to $20.1 billion in 2021. Gross margin was 52%, up 370 basis points from the prior year,\nprimarily driven by richer product mix with higher revenue from Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment\nrevenue.\nOperating expenses were 26% of revenue compared to 24% in 2021. 2022 operating income was $6.3 billion, up $2.3 billion, an increase of 56%\nfrom a year ago resulting in operating margin of 27% compared to 25% in 2021, primarily driven by higher revenue and gross margin expansion.\nNet income was $5.5 billion compared to $3.4 billion, up 60% from the prior year. Earnings per share was $3.50 compared to $2.79 for the prior\nyear, primarily due to Data Center growth and addition of Xilinx.\nFull year free cash flow was $3.1 billion, resulting free cash flow margin of 13% for the year. We invested approximately $1 billion in long-term\nsupply chain capacity in 2022 to support our expectations for future revenue growth and increase market share.Let me now turn to our financial outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current macro environment. For\nthe first quarter of 2023, we expect revenue to be approximately $5.3 billion, plus or minus $300 million, a decrease of approximately 10%\nyear-over-year and 5% sequentially. Year-over-year Data Center and Embedded segment revenue are expected to grow, offset by lower Client and\nGaming segment revenue. Sequentially, Embedded segment revenue is expected to increase. Client and Gaming segment revenue are expected\nto decline largely consistent with seasonality. Data Center segment revenue is expected to decline due to elevated levels of inventory with some\ncloud customers."

        "Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C.

Can\nyou give us any idea like first half to second half? Or I mean just for the full year, do you think gross margins grow year-over-year from the 52% that\nyou printed in 2022?\nJean X. Hu - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO\nStacy, this is Jean. Let me take this question, then Lisa can add. As we talk about it, it's both our Embedded and Data Center segment have strong\ngross margins. So we feel pretty good about second half.We continue to have the growth of both Embedded and Data Center segment. The major headwind we are facing is really Client side, which if you\nthink about the gross margin in the first half of 2022 versus the first half of 2023, the major impact is from the client revenue, inventory correction,\nwhich impact the gross margin in the Client segment.\nSo going into second half, the normalization of the Client segment will help us to expand the gross margin. I think it really depends on how the\nClient segment will recover. That will drive the gross margin if it's going to go back to the first half of 2022 or expand beyond that level. But overall,\nwe feel pretty good. Once we normalize the Client segment, our gross margin will continue to expand.\n9\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2023 Refinitiv.

I think it depends a bit on what happens\nin the macro environment. But we do feel good about second half expansion, and we'll see sort of the relative recovery in macro as it relates to all\nof our segments.\nStacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst\nGot it. I guess for my follow-up, maybe it follows up on that a little bit more just around the mix. I get how Data Center and Embedded should begrowing in the second half versus the first half. But presumably, Client will, too, first half to second half, given that you are under-shipping, it sounds\nlike by a pretty wide margin right now. How do you feel about your mix just across the 4 businesses of the second half versus the first half?\nDo you think your Data Center plus Embedded mix, as a percentage of total revenue in the second half, is materially higher than it is in the first\nhalf? Or I mean could it even be not that different at all given the potential growth that you might see just from the channel normalization in clients?\nLisa Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Chair of the BoardYes. I think the way to think about it is, I think our Data Center grow -- growth in the second half versus first half, we expect that to be significantly\nstronger. As it relates to clients, we would also expect it to be stronger. Again, depending a bit on macro and sort of how the TAM actually evolves.\nI think for the Embedded businesses, I would say that we expect to grow over the full year 2023 versus 2022.

        "Economic and Strategic RisksIntel Corporation’s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices maylimit our ability to compete effectively on a level playing field.Intel\nCorporation has been the market share leader for microprocessors for many years. Intel’s market share,margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to\ntarget our customersand our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. Theseaggressive activities have in the past resulted in lower unit sales and a\nlower average selling price for many ofour products and adversely affect our margins and profitability.Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distributionthrough variousbrand and other marketing programs. As a result of Intel’s position in the microprocessor market, Intel has beenable to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and\nbenchmarks and to dictate the type ofproducts the microprocessor market requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, whichincludes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, networking\ndevices (wired and wireless), non-volatile storage andother components necessary to assemble a computer system. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de factostandards and specifications for x86\nmicroprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayedaccess to such standards.As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intel’sbusinesspractices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share andmargins; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing\nand merchandising strategies;exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers, retailers and channel partners; de facto control overindustry standards, and heavy influence on PC\nmanufacturers and other PC industry participants, includingmotherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system (BIOS) suppliers and software companies as wellas the graphics interface for Intel\nplatforms; and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioningthe Intel brand over the brand of its original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers and retailers.Intel hassubstantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greateramounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to continue to invest\nheavilyin marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To theextent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor\nproducts using more advancedprocess technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be morevulnerable to Intel’s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies\nfor microprocessor products.Intel could also take actions that place our discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) at a competitivedisadvantage, including giving one or more of our competitors in thegraphics market, such as NvidiaCorporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information. Also, Intel hasannounced that it is developing their own high-end\ndiscrete GPUs. Intel’s position in the microprocessor marketand integrated graphics chipset market, its introduction of competitive new products, its existing relationships withtop-tier OEMs, and its\naggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and loweraverage selling prices for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us.Global economic and\nmarket uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating results.Uncertain global economic conditions have in the past and may in the future adversely impact our business,including, without"

In some circumstances, wemay pursue growth through\nthe acquisition of complementary businesses, solutions or technologies or throughjoint ventures or investments rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisitionor\njoint venture candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfullycomplete identified acquisitions or joint ventures.For example, on October 26, 2020, we,along with a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, entered into anAgreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx), whereby we agreed to acquireXilinx (the Merger). We\nentered into the Merger Agreement with the belief that the Merger will result in certainbenefits, including certain operational synergies and cost efficiencies, and drive product innovations.\nAchievingthese anticipated benefits will depend on successfully combining our and Xilinx’s businesses together. It is notcertain that Xilinx’s business can be successfully integrated with our business\nin a timely manner or at all, or thatany of the anticipated benefits will be realized for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to: failure toobtain applicable regulatory approval in atimely manner or otherwise; failure to satisfy other closing conditions tothe Merger; our inability to integrate or benefit from Xilinx’s acquired technologies or services in a profitablemanner;\ndiversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention from our existing business;unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the Merger; failure to leverage the increased\nscale of thecombined businesses quickly and effectively; coordinating and integrating in countries in which we have notpreviously operated; the potential impact of the Merger on our relationships with\nemployees, vendors, suppliersand customers; the impairment of relationships with, or the loss of, Xilinx’s employees, vendors, suppliers andcustomers; adverse changes in general economic conditions inregions in which we and Xilinx operate; potentiallitigation associated41\nApril 28, 2021 - 10-Q: Quarterly report pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d...https://ir.amd.com/financial-information/sec-filings/content/0000002...\n66 von 7920.10.2025, 10:26\nApril 28, 2021 - 10-Q: Quarterly report pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d...https://ir.amd.com/financial-information/sec-filings/content/0000002...\n67 von 7920.10.2025, 10:26\nwith the Merger; difficulties in the assimilation of employees and culture; difficulties in managing the expandedoperations of a larger and more complex company; challenges in attracting and\nretaining key personnel; anddifficulties with harmonizing our and Xilinx’s financial reporting systems.

Servers are also\nused in cloud computing, which is a computing model wheredata, applications and services are delivered over the internet or an intranet which can be rapidly provisioned and releasedwith minimal\neffort. Today’s datacenters require new technologies and configuration models to meet the demand driven bythe growing amount of data that needs to be stored, accessed and managed. Servers must be\nefficient, scalable and adaptableto meet the compute characteristics of new and changing workloads.Embedded. Embedded products address computing needs in PC-adjacent markets, such as industrialcontrol andautomation, digital signage, point-of-sale/self-service kiosks, medical imaging and casino gaming machines as well asenterprise-class telecommunications, networking, security, storage\nsystems and thin clients (which are computers that serveas an access device on a network). Typically, AMD embedded products are used in applications that require high to moderatelevels of performance,\nwhere key features may include mobility, relatively low power, small form factor, and 24x7operations. High-performance graphics are increasingly important in many embedded systems. Support for Linux\n,Windows® and other operating systems as well as for increasingly sophisticated applications are also critical for somecustomers. Other requirements may include meeting rigid specifications forindustrial temperatures, shock, vibration andreliability. The embedded market has moved from developing proprietary, custom designs to leveraging industry-standardinstruction set architectures and\nprocessors as a way to help reduce costs and speed time to market.Semi-Custom. We have leveraged our core IP, including our graphics and processing technologies developed for thegaming, VR, AR and\nmachine intelligence markets, to develop semi-custom solutions for customers who wantdifferentiation in their products. In this market, semiconductor suppliers work alongside system designers and\nmanufacturersto enhance the performance and overall user experience for semi-custom customers. AMD has used this type of collaborativedevelopment approach with many of today’s leading game consolemanufacturers and can also address customer needs inmany other markets beyond game consoles. AMD leverages our existing IP to create a variety of products tailored to aspecific customer’s needs,\nranging from complex fully-customized SoCs to more modest adaptations and integrations ofexisting CPU, APU or GPU products.Our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom ProductsServer Processors. Our\nmicroprocessors for server platforms currently include the AMD EPYC™ Series processors andAMD Opteron™ Series processors.

Consumers increasingly demand computing devices with\nimproved end-userexperience, system performance and energy efficiency. Consumers also continue to demand thinner and lighter mobiledevices, with better performance and longer battery life. We believe\nthat a computing architecture that optimizes the use ofits components can provide these improvements.An APU is a processing unit that integrates a CPU and a GPU onto one chip (or one piece of\nsilicon), along with, insome cases, other special-purpose components. This integration enhances system performance by “offloading” selected tasksto the best-suited component (i.e., the CPU or the GPU)to optimize component use, increasing the speed of data flowbetween the CPU and GPU through shared memory and allowing the GPU to function as both a graphics engine and anapplication accelerator.\nHaving the CPU and GPU on the same chip also typically improves energy efficiency by, forexample, eliminating connections between discrete chips.Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA) describes an\nindustry standard that is an overarching design for havingcombinations of CPU and GPU processor cores that operate as a unified, integrated engine that shares system responsibilitiesand resources. AMD\nis a founding member of the HSA Foundation, a non-profit organization established to define andpromote this open standards-based approach to heterogeneous computing. Heterogeneous computing allows for\nthe elevationof the GPU to the same level of the CPU for memory access, queuing and execution. This capability allows softwareprogrammers to develop applications to more fully utilize GPUcapabilities.System-on-Chip (SoC). An SoC is a type of IC with a CPU, GPU and other components, such as a memory controllerand peripheral management, comprising a complete computing system on a single\nchip. By combining all of these elementsas an SoC, system performance and energy efficiency is improved, similar to an APU.Chipset. A chipset is a generic term referring to a collection of system\nlevel components that manage data flow among amicroprocessor or microprocessors, memory and peripherals (such as CD ROM drives, DVD drives and USB peripherals).Chipsets perform essential logic\nfunctions, balance a system’s performance and provide system control and powermanagement functions. Some chipsets have graphics capabilities by including an integrated graphics processor (IGP)\nwithinthe chipset. A chipset with an IGP is known as an IGP chipset. IGP chipsets can offer a lower cost, reduced power alternativeto a discrete GPU, and are often also used in smaller form factors.\nSystems that are powered by an APU or by a CPU anddiscrete GPU combination often do not have a chipset and instead use an AMD Controller Hub chip to perform the functionsof a chipset. As a result, we\nbelieve that either an APU and AMD Controller Hub chip combination or an SoC, which alreadyincludes a chipset, will eventually replace the market for IGP chipsets.Our x86 Microprocessor and ChipsetProductsOur microprocessors are incorporated into computing platforms, which are a collection of technologies that are designedto work together to provide a more complete computing solution and to\nenable and advance the computing components. Webelieve that integrated, balanced computing platforms consisting of microprocessors, chipsets (either as discrete devices orintegrated into an SoC) and\nGPUs (either as discrete GPUs or integrated into an APU or SoC) that work together at thesystem level bring end users improved system stability, increased performance and enhanced power efficiency. In\naddition,we believe our customers also benefit from an all-AMD platform (consisting of an APU or CPU, a discrete GPU, and anAMD Fusion Controller Hub chip when needed), as we are able to optimize"

See Cautionary Statement on\nSlide 2. These forward-looking outlook statements and non-GAAP measures are based on current expectations as of January 31, 2023, and assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks anduncertainties. AMD undertakes no intent or obligation to publicly update or revise its outlook statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\nAll items, except revenue, are on a non-GAAP basis. Adjustments to arrive at the GAAP financial outlook typically include stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, income\ntax provision, equity income in investee, and other non- recurring items such as loss on debt redemption/conversion, impairment charges and acquisition-related costs. The timing and impact of such\nadjustments are dependent on future events that are typically uncertain or outside of AMD's control, therefore, a reconciliation to equivalent GAAP measures is not practicable at this time. 2.

        "Jean X. Hu - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. 2022 was a very strong year for AMD. We had a record revenue, gross margin, profitability, and we\ngenerated significant free cash flow. The year was also highlighted by our strategic acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando, expanding and diversifying\nour business portfolio.\nFourth quarter 2022 revenue for $5.6 billion was up 16% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue in the Embedded and Data Center segment,\npartially offset by lower Client and the Gaming segment revenue. Gross margin was 51%, up 70 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by\nricher product mix with higher revenue in Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. Operatingexpenses were $1.6 billion compared to $1.1 billion a year ago, driven by the inclusion of Xilinx OpEx and additional R&D and go-to-market\ninvestments to support the next phase of our revenue growth.\nOperating income declined $66 million from a year ago to $1.3 billion, and the operating margin was 23%, down from 27% a year ago. Net income\nwas $1.1 billion flat year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.92 per share a year ago, primarily due to lower client\noperating income.\nNow turning to our reportable segment for the fourth quarter. Starting with the Data Center segment. Revenue was $1.7 billion, up 42% year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by strong growth in third-generation EPYC server processor revenue and the early ramp of fourth-generation EPYC processors.Data center operating income was $444 million or 27% of revenue compared to $369 million or 32% a year ago. Higher operating income was\ndriven primarily by stronger revenue, partially offset by higher R&D investment to support the top line revenue growth.\nClient segment revenue was $903 million, down 51% year-over-year due to reduced processor shipments resulting from a weak PC market and\nsignificant inventory correction across the PC supply chain. Client operating loss was $152 million compared to operating income of $530 million\na year ago or 29% of revenue, primarily due to lower revenue.\nGaming segment revenue was $1.6 billion, down 7% year-over-year due to lower gaming graphics revenue, partially offset by higher semi-customerproduct sales. Gaming operating income was $266 million or 16% of revenue compared to $407 million or 23% a year ago. The decrease was\nprimarily due to lower graphics revenue.\nEmbedded segment revenue was $1.4 billion, up $1.3 billion from a year ago, primarily due to the inclusion of Xilinx Embedded revenue. Embedded\noperating income was $699 million or 50% of revenue compared to $18 million or 25% a year ago, primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx.\n5\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2023 Refinitiv.

We have a strong balance sheet with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment of $5.9 billion at the end of\nthe fourth quarter. During the quarter, we returned $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases. In 2022, we returned a total of $3.7\nbillion to shareholders which was 119% of free cash flow. We have $6.5 billion in remaining authorization to share repurchases. Free cash flow was\n$443 million compared to $736 million in the same quarter last year.\nFree cash flow decreased primarily due to higher inventory. Inventory was $3.8 billion, up approximately $402 million from the prior quarter,\nprimarily driven by the inventory increase in advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products.Now let me turn to our full year financial results. 2022 revenue was $23.6 billion, up 44% year-over-year, driven by increased Embedded, Data\nCenter and the Gaming segment revenue, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. On our combined AMD and Xilinx company basis, 2022\npro forma revenue was $24.1 billion, up 20% compared to $20.1 billion in 2021. Gross margin was 52%, up 370 basis points from the prior year,\nprimarily driven by richer product mix with higher revenue from Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment\nrevenue.\nOperating expenses were 26% of revenue compared to 24% in 2021. 2022 operating income was $6.3 billion, up $2.3 billion, an increase of 56%\nfrom a year ago resulting in operating margin of 27% compared to 25% in 2021, primarily driven by higher revenue and gross margin expansion.\nNet income was $5.5 billion compared to $3.4 billion, up 60% from the prior year. Earnings per share was $3.50 compared to $2.79 for the prior\nyear, primarily due to Data Center growth and addition of Xilinx.\nFull year free cash flow was $3.1 billion, resulting free cash flow margin of 13% for the year. We invested approximately $1 billion in long-term\nsupply chain capacity in 2022 to support our expectations for future revenue growth and increase market share."

AMD undertakes no intent or obligation to publicly update or revise its outlook statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\nAll items, except revenue, are on a non-GAAP basis. Adjustments to arrive at the GAAP financial outlook typically include stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, income\ntax provision, equity income in investee, and other non- recurring items such as loss on debt redemption/conversion, impairment charges and acquisition-related costs. The timing and impact of such\nadjustments are dependent on future events that are typically uncertain or outside of AMD's control, therefore, a reconciliation to equivalent GAAP measures is not practicable at this time. 2.

While overall PC demand remains soft, desktop channel sell-through increased\nsequentially during the holiday season. We launched our latest generation Ryzen 7000 series notebook processors earlier in January, including our\nRyzen 7040 CPU series that deliver leadership performance in battery life and are our first processors to feature Ryzen AI, the industry's only dedicated\non-chip AI inference engine in an x86 processor. Ryzen AI is powered by the highly scalable XDNA architecture, which is the first integration of\nAMD and Xilinx IP, less than a year after closing the acquisition.\nWe also launched our Ryzen 7045 series CPUs, our first mobile processor based on a chiplet design that delivers significantly higher performance\nthan the competition in gaming and content creation applications. We have more than 250 ultrathin gaming and commercial notebook design\nwins, spanning our full family of Ryzen 7000 series processors on track to launch this year, an increase of 25% year-over-year with the first notebooks\nplanned to go on sale in February.Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 7% year-over-year to $1.6 billion as lower gaming graphics sales more than offset higher\nsemi-custom revenue. Semi-custom SoC revenue grew year-over-year as demand for game consoles remained strong during the holidays. Gaming\ngraphics revenue declined year-over-year as we further reduced desktop GPU downstream channel inventory. Channel sell-through of our Radeon\nRX GPUs increased sequentially, and we launched our high-end Radeon 7900 series GPUs to strong demand based on the performance of our new\nRDNA 3 architecture and 5-nanometer chiplet design.\nIn January, we announced our first RDNA 3 mobile GPUs that have been selected to power new gaming notebooks from Dell, Alienware, ASUS and\nothers that are on track to begin shipping in the first half of 2023.Looking at our Embedded segment. Revenue increased significantly year-over-year to a record $1.4 billion. We had record sales across a number\nof our Embedded markets, including communications, automotive, industrial and health care, aerospace and defense, and test and emulation. In\ncommunications, we saw particular strength with expanded 5G wireless installations in India and ongoing wired infrastructure deployments with\nTier 1 communications providers. Automotive growth was driven by the ramps of new Ford camera, 4D radar and infotainment wins across multiple\ncustomers. We recently announced multiple new wins for our automotive grade Zynq UltraScale+ platforms with some of the largest vehicleequipment suppliers including Aisin next-generation Automated Parking Assist system and DENSO's next-generation LiDAR platform that can\nimprove the resolution required for autonomous driving and other industrial machine vision applications by 20x.\nWe also continued to see strong growth with industrial and health care, aerospace and defense and tested and emulation customers in the quarter,\ndriven by SAM expansion for our leadership-adaptive SoCs, new design win ramps and increased supply across multiple nodes.\nTaking a step back, as we approach the 1-year anniversary of the closing of our Xilinx acquisition next month, the integration has gone extremely\nwell, and our Embedded business has become a major growth driver for AMD, strengthening our financial model and significantly diversifying our\nbusiness. In addition, we are seeing substantial new revenue synergy opportunities as we combine Xilinx's industry-leading adaptive products and\n6,000-plus customers with AMD's expanded breadth of compute products and scale.In summary, overall, 2022 was a strong year for AMD despite the weak PC market. We significantly grew our Data Center, Embedded and Gaming\nbusinesses and executed well across our product portfolio. As we enter 2023, we expect the overall demand environment to remain mixed with\n4\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2023 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

        "Jean X. Hu - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. 2022 was a very strong year for AMD. We had a record revenue, gross margin, profitability, and we\ngenerated significant free cash flow. The year was also highlighted by our strategic acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando, expanding and diversifying\nour business portfolio.\nFourth quarter 2022 revenue for $5.6 billion was up 16% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue in the Embedded and Data Center segment,\npartially offset by lower Client and the Gaming segment revenue. Gross margin was 51%, up 70 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by\nricher product mix with higher revenue in Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. Operatingexpenses were $1.6 billion compared to $1.1 billion a year ago, driven by the inclusion of Xilinx OpEx and additional R&D and go-to-market\ninvestments to support the next phase of our revenue growth.\nOperating income declined $66 million from a year ago to $1.3 billion, and the operating margin was 23%, down from 27% a year ago. Net income\nwas $1.1 billion flat year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.92 per share a year ago, primarily due to lower client\noperating income.\nNow turning to our reportable segment for the fourth quarter. Starting with the Data Center segment. Revenue was $1.7 billion, up 42% year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by strong growth in third-generation EPYC server processor revenue and the early ramp of fourth-generation EPYC processors.Data center operating income was $444 million or 27% of revenue compared to $369 million or 32% a year ago. Higher operating income was\ndriven primarily by stronger revenue, partially offset by higher R&D investment to support the top line revenue growth.\nClient segment revenue was $903 million, down 51% year-over-year due to reduced processor shipments resulting from a weak PC market and\nsignificant inventory correction across the PC supply chain. Client operating loss was $152 million compared to operating income of $530 million\na year ago or 29% of revenue, primarily due to lower revenue.\nGaming segment revenue was $1.6 billion, down 7% year-over-year due to lower gaming graphics revenue, partially offset by higher semi-customerproduct sales. Gaming operating income was $266 million or 16% of revenue compared to $407 million or 23% a year ago. The decrease was\nprimarily due to lower graphics revenue.\nEmbedded segment revenue was $1.4 billion, up $1.3 billion from a year ago, primarily due to the inclusion of Xilinx Embedded revenue. Embedded\noperating income was $699 million or 50% of revenue compared to $18 million or 25% a year ago, primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx.\n5\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2023 Refinitiv.

We have a strong balance sheet with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment of $5.9 billion at the end of\nthe fourth quarter. During the quarter, we returned $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases. In 2022, we returned a total of $3.7\nbillion to shareholders which was 119% of free cash flow. We have $6.5 billion in remaining authorization to share repurchases. Free cash flow was\n$443 million compared to $736 million in the same quarter last year.\nFree cash flow decreased primarily due to higher inventory. Inventory was $3.8 billion, up approximately $402 million from the prior quarter,\nprimarily driven by the inventory increase in advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products.Now let me turn to our full year financial results. 2022 revenue was $23.6 billion, up 44% year-over-year, driven by increased Embedded, Data\nCenter and the Gaming segment revenue, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. On our combined AMD and Xilinx company basis, 2022\npro forma revenue was $24.1 billion, up 20% compared to $20.1 billion in 2021. Gross margin was 52%, up 370 basis points from the prior year,\nprimarily driven by richer product mix with higher revenue from Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment\nrevenue.\nOperating expenses were 26% of revenue compared to 24% in 2021. 2022 operating income was $6.3 billion, up $2.3 billion, an increase of 56%\nfrom a year ago resulting in operating margin of 27% compared to 25% in 2021, primarily driven by higher revenue and gross margin expansion.\nNet income was $5.5 billion compared to $3.4 billion, up 60% from the prior year. Earnings per share was $3.50 compared to $2.79 for the prior\nyear, primarily due to Data Center growth and addition of Xilinx.\nFull year free cash flow was $3.1 billion, resulting free cash flow margin of 13% for the year. We invested approximately $1 billion in long-term\nsupply chain capacity in 2022 to support our expectations for future revenue growth and increase market share.Let me now turn to our financial outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current macro environment. For\nthe first quarter of 2023, we expect revenue to be approximately $5.3 billion, plus or minus $300 million, a decrease of approximately 10%\nyear-over-year and 5% sequentially. Year-over-year Data Center and Embedded segment revenue are expected to grow, offset by lower Client and\nGaming segment revenue. Sequentially, Embedded segment revenue is expected to increase. Client and Gaming segment revenue are expected\nto decline largely consistent with seasonality. Data Center segment revenue is expected to decline due to elevated levels of inventory with some\ncloud customers.In addition, for Q1 2023, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 50%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.6\nbillion; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $146 million based on a 13% effective tax rate. Diluted share count is\nexpected to be approximately 1.62 billion shares. For the full year of 2023, we are not providing specific guidance due to the uncertainty in the\nmacro environment. However, let me provide some color.\nDirectionally, we expect Embedded and Data Center annual revenue to grow from 2022 based on the strength of our product portfolio and expected\nshare gains. In addition, we expect Client and the Gaming segment revenue to decline based on the current demand environment. We expect"

During the threemonths ended March 27, 2021, the highergross margin from the richer mix of our Ryzen, Radeon and EPYCprocessors sales was offset by a higher proportion of sales of our semi-custom products, which have a lowergross margin than the Company’s\naverage.ExpensesResearch and Development ExpensesResearch and development expenses of $610 million for the three months ended March 27, 2021 increased by$168 million, or 38%, compared to $442 million\nfor the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by anincrease in product development costs in both the Computing and Graphics and Enterprise, Embedded andSemi-Custom segments due to an\nincrease in headcount and higher annual employee incentives driven byimproved financial performance.Marketing, General and Administrative ExpensesMarketing, general and administrative expenses of $319million for the three months ended March 27, 2021increased by $120 million, or 60%, compared to $199 million for the prior year period. The increase was primarilydue to an increase in go-to-market\nactivities in both the Computing and Graphics and Enterprise, Embedded andSemi-Custom segments, an increase in headcount and higher annual employee incentives driven by improvedfinancial performance.\nIn addition, we incurred $15 million of acquisition-related costs for the three months endedMarch 27, 2021 in connection with our pending acquisition of Xilinx, Inc.Licensing GainDuring the three\nmonths ended March 27, 2021, we recognized $4 million of royalty income associated with thelicensed IP to THATIC JV.Interest ExpenseInterest expense for the three months ended March 27, 2021 was $9million compared to $13 million for the prioryear period.

The lower income tax expenseand effective tax rate for the prior\nyear period was due to a full valuation allowance in the United States during2020, a significant portion of which was released by us in the fourth quarter of 2020.As of March 27, 2021, we continue to\nmaintain a valuation allowance for certain federal, state, and foreign taxattributes.

        "Turning to the balance sheet. We have a strong balance sheet with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment of $5.9 billion at the end of\nthe fourth quarter. During the quarter, we returned $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases. In 2022, we returned a total of $3.7\nbillion to shareholders which was 119% of free cash flow. We have $6.5 billion in remaining authorization to share repurchases. Free cash flow was\n$443 million compared to $736 million in the same quarter last year.\nFree cash flow decreased primarily due to higher inventory. Inventory was $3.8 billion, up approximately $402 million from the prior quarter,\nprimarily driven by the inventory increase in advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products.Now let me turn to our full year financial results. 2022 revenue was $23.6 billion, up 44% year-over-year, driven by increased Embedded, Data\nCenter and the Gaming segment revenue, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. On our combined AMD and Xilinx company basis, 2022\npro forma revenue was $24.1 billion, up 20% compared to $20.1 billion in 2021. Gross margin was 52%, up 370 basis points from the prior year,\nprimarily driven by richer product mix with higher revenue from Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment\nrevenue.\nOperating expenses were 26% of revenue compared to 24% in 2021. 2022 operating income was $6.3 billion, up $2.3 billion, an increase of 56%\nfrom a year ago resulting in operating margin of 27% compared to 25% in 2021, primarily driven by higher revenue and gross margin expansion.\nNet income was $5.5 billion compared to $3.4 billion, up 60% from the prior year. Earnings per share was $3.50 compared to $2.79 for the prior\nyear, primarily due to Data Center growth and addition of Xilinx.\nFull year free cash flow was $3.1 billion, resulting free cash flow margin of 13% for the year. We invested approximately $1 billion in long-term\nsupply chain capacity in 2022 to support our expectations for future revenue growth and increase market share.Let me now turn to our financial outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current macro environment. For\nthe first quarter of 2023, we expect revenue to be approximately $5.3 billion, plus or minus $300 million, a decrease of approximately 10%\nyear-over-year and 5% sequentially. Year-over-year Data Center and Embedded segment revenue are expected to grow, offset by lower Client and\nGaming segment revenue. Sequentially, Embedded segment revenue is expected to increase. Client and Gaming segment revenue are expected\nto decline largely consistent with seasonality. Data Center segment revenue is expected to decline due to elevated levels of inventory with some\ncloud customers.In addition, for Q1 2023, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 50%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.6\nbillion; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $146 million based on a 13% effective tax rate. Diluted share count is\nexpected to be approximately 1.62 billion shares. For the full year of 2023, we are not providing specific guidance due to the uncertainty in the\nmacro environment. However, let me provide some color.\nDirectionally, we expect Embedded and Data Center annual revenue to grow from 2022 based on the strength of our product portfolio and expected\nshare gains. In addition, we expect Client and the Gaming segment revenue to decline based on the current demand environment. We expectnon-GAAP gross margin to be approximately flattish in the first half and the expansion in the second half of the year. We expect to manage quarterly\nnon-GAAP operating expenses flat with the fourth quarter until we see the demand environment improves. For modeling purpose, we expect\nnon-GAAP effective tax rate for the year to be 13% and the diluted share count to be approximately 1.62 billion shares.\nIn closing, we had a strong year with record revenue and profitability, driven by our leadership in product portfolio and the diversification of our\nbusiness. Looking forward to 2023, as Lisa mentioned earlier, we'll continue to focus on executing our long-term growth strategy while driving"

The Revolving CreditAgreement provides for a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the aggregate\nprincipal amount of $3.0billion. There were no funds drawn from this facility during the year ended December 31, 2022.On November 3, 2022, we established a new commercial paper program where we may\nissue unsecuredcommercial paper notes up to a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion with a maturityof up to 397 days from the date of issue.

        "Lisa Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Chair of the Board\nSure. So maybe let me separate Data Center and Client because they're a little bit different. I think on the Data Center side, we would\n-- we do see that, in general, the performance, the power performance, the total cost of ownership, selling the solution is the most\nimportant piece of it because the solutions are actually quite different in terms of what you can do between sort of 4th Gen EPYC\nand sort of other solutions. The environment is always competitive, but we feel very good about the overall value proposition that\nwe bring to both cloud and enterprise customers.\nI think on the Client side, we've said for the last couple of quarters that the pricing environment is more aggressive. I think thatnormally happens when the industry is working on rebalancing. I think we're working on rebalancing, our OEM partners are working\non rebalancing. The retailers are working on rebalancing. And so there are more incentives and more -- a more aggressive pricing\nenvironment.\nI view that, that's primarily on, let's call it, older products, let's call it previous generation products. And as we work through that,\nthere will be some normalization as we think about our newer generation products, where there's more capability added. So hopefully,\nthat gives you a little bit of the puts and takes.\nAnd in terms of the cost environment, I think all of us in the industry have seen some elevated costs, but I think we also see -- expectthat to normalize, too, as everyone is sort of optimizing their CapEx spending.\nOperator\nYour next question today is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.\n15\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2023 Refinitiv.

Two questions, if I may. First, on the PC side. Can you give us a sense about roughly how far under\nconsumption, you believe, you're shipping on the PC side, either in Q4 and Q1?\nAnd Lisa, correct me if I'm wrong, I thought I heard you say in an answer to an earlier question that you expect the PC client just to\ngrow into second quarter. So does that suggest that 1Q, you think, is the bottom on the PC? And then I had a follow-up.\nLisa Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Chair of the Board\nSure, Mark. So we -- so the first -- the second question, yes. We do believe the first quarter is the bottom for our PC market -- for our\nPC business, and we'll see some growth in the second quarter and then a seasonally higher second half.In terms of the under shipment, I mean, I think we're -- we under-shipped in Q3, we under-shipped in Q4. We will under-ship, to a\nlesser extent, in Q1. So I think you can infer that from our guidance of single-digit down. And then we'll be back to a more normal\nenvironment.\nNow just as a reminder, though, the first half is not usually a -- the first half is usually a seasonally weak client time anyways. So we\nwould expect more lift in the second half, not so much in the second quarter.\nMark John Lipacis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research AnalystGot you. Okay. That's very helpful. And then a follow-up, if I may, on the -- China is lifting, as they're lifting the COVID restrictions, I\nguess I would imagine that you would expect that ultimately, at some point, to translate into higher demand. And I'm wondering if\nyou could just kind of share with us your thoughts about how that might play out. And could you remind us, to the extent that you\ncan help us understand the risk to the supply side for you in the event that the COVID spreads rapidly as they lift the restrictions and\nimpacts what you have on the supply side there.\nLisa Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Chair of the Board\nSure, Mark. So we've done a very good job in our supply chain in terms of risk mitigation. So we have -- we don't believe that wehave a significant risk as it relates to COVID future outbreaks, if there are any. As it relates to China recovery, I think we would benefit\nfrom a China recovery. It's very difficult to call. I mean we've seen, certainly in our Data Center business, we saw in the second half\nof the year and last year in the first half of this year that the China Data Center business has been weak for us. If there was a recovery,\nI think we would benefit from that. Similarly, some of the other consumer patterns as well. But it's very difficult to call. So we put\nthat in the bucket of macro uncertainty, and we'll see how it plays out.\nRuth Cotter - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP of Marketing, HR & IR\nOperator, we'll take 2 more questions from 2 callers, please.\nOperatorCertainly.

Congrats on being the first all-female CEO, CFO team. It's a long time coming. So your gross margins held up pretty well for\nthe Q1 guide despite high-margin Data Center business going down. So if the Data Center business remains weak and has a rough\nquarter in Q2, can we expect a similar gross margin resiliency?\nJean X. Hu - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO\nYes, definitely. I think as I said earlier, the major impact on gross margin actually is the PC Client side. The stabilization and the\nbottoming of Client on the business really help us with the gross margin at the current level. Second half, we should see the expansion\nof gross margin.\nChristopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD & AnalystSure. And as my follow-up on your PC Client business, so it had its correction a little bit later than some of the other folks in the semi\nindustry and was obviously a little bit steeper. Can you talk about why that happened and why we should or should not expect that?\nOr could that happen in the Data Center business as well?\nLisa Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Chair of the Board\nI guess Chris, what I would say is I think the PC market has been volatile, and we did significantly -- coming off the pandemic, there\nwas very high demand during the pandemic, and I think we were all adjusting as we're looking at sort of the demand environmentpost-pandemic and with macro uncertainty. I think the Data Center business, we have again, our -- we're heavily weighted towards\ncloud, and we have very good discussions with our overall customer set in terms of what they need. I think what's going in our favor\nin the Data Center is our workloads are expanding. And so we've heard from all of our cloud customers that they're adopting both\nMilan and Genoa in more workloads than previous. And so I think that gives us good confidence.\nAnd frankly, the Data Center customers are also giving us good visibility into what they need for 2023. So there is an adjustment in\nthe first half. And I think that's something that we understand. And we also expect that we're going to have to ramp up productionin the second half as some of the demand resumes. And I think the overall factor of compute in the cloud being a very important\nlong-term driver is definitely there. So we feel good about sort of where we're positioned.\nOperator\nOur final question today is coming from Timothy Arcuri from UBS.\nTimothy Michael Arcuri - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment\nLisa, I had a question on your Client business. I know that your competitor at times uses rebates and subsidies. But the numbers that\nare in their filings have gotten pretty vague. So I take it from your answer to a prior question that you think that's more on legacyparts. I guess I'm just kind of wondering what changes or impact that's had on your business.

        "are being used in the PC and server markets, which could lead to further growth and development of the ARMecosystem. In 2020, Nvidia announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire ARM\nHoldings. Nvidia isour principal competitor in the discrete graphics market. Our ability to compete with companies who use ARM-based solutions depends on our ability to timely design and bring to\nmarket energy-efficient, high-performingproducts at an attractive price point.Competition in the Graphics MarketsIn the graphics market, our competitors include suppliers of discrete graphics,\nembedded graphics processorsand integrated graphics processor (IGP) chipsets. Intel manufactures and sells embedded graphics processorsand IGP chipsets and is a dominant competitor with respect tothis portion of our business. Higher unit shipmentsof our APUs and Intel’s integrated graphics may drive computer manufacturers to reduce the number of systemsthey build paired with discrete graphics\ncomponents, particularly for notebooks, because they may offersatisfactory graphics performance for most mainstream PC users at a lower cost. Intel could take actions thatplace our discrete GPUs and\nIGP chipsets at a competitive disadvantage such as providing preferential access toits proprietary graphics interface or other useful information to our competitors in the graphics market\norrestricting access to external companies, while developing its own high-end discrete GPUs for both consumerand commercial applications.Our principal competitor in the discrete graphics market isNvidia and they are considered the market shareleader. We believe that the growing complexity of graphics processors and the associated research anddevelopment costs represent a high and growing\nbarrier to entry in this market.Also, Intel has announced that it is developing their own high-end discrete GPUs.Competition in the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom MarketsIn the server market, we\ncompete against Intel with our CPU server products and Nvidia with our GPU serverproducts.In the data center, our principal competitor is Nvidia as the adoption of its proprietary CUDA software\nplatformestablished its market share in HPC and machine learning. Another competitor is Intel as it builds products foracceleration in the data center, such as Intel Xe or Habana AI processors. Othercompetitors include numerousdeep learning accelerator companies, consisting mostly of early to late stage start-ups. Large cloud serviceproviders have also shown interest in building their own\nproducts to accelerate AI.We are the market share leader in semi-custom game console products, where graphics performance is critical,and where we compete primarily against Nvidia.Research and\nDevelopmentWe focus our research and development activities on improving product performance and enhancing productdesign. Our main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of CPU and GPU IP\n, and designing that IPinto our SoCs for our next generation of products, with, in each case, improved system performance andperformance-per-watt characteristics. For example, we are focusing onimproving the battery life of our APUproducts for notebooks and the performance and power efficiency of our discrete GPUs and our microprocessorsfor servers. Another important area of focus is on HPC.\nHPC has traditionally been synonymous with scientificcomputing and supercomputers, but we are seeing a blurring of boundaries between HPC and machine learningalong with high-performance CPU and GPU\ndeployments going into workstations and cloud computing datacenters as well as supercomputers. We are also focusing on delivering a range of low-power integrated platformsto serve key markets,\nincluding commercial clients, mobile computing and gaming. We believe these platformswill bring customers increased performance and energy efficiency. We also work on advanced memorytechnologies. AsSoC technology advances, the memory can sometimes limit CPU performance and we work onimproving memory technology to improve performance. Another area of focus is machine intelligence which is\ntheplatform for the growing field of machine learning. Our CPUs, GPUs, accelerators, and APUs offer thecomputation capability and the flexibility required for various deployments of machine learning.\nWe also work withindustry leaders on process technology, software and other functional intellectual property and with others in theindustry and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and\ndevelopment. We conduct product andsystem research and development activities for our products in the United States with additional design anddevelopment engineering teams located in Canada, China,"

Since 1981, the Company has discovered hazardous materialreleases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conductremediationat these three sites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in thesemiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979.In 1991, the\nCompany received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional WaterQuality Control Board relating to the three sites. The Company has entered into settlement agreements with\notherresponsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties have agreed toassume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting\nremediation activities under theorders. The Company remains responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as allremaining costs in the event that the other parties do notfulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements.To address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, the Company has computed and recorded anestimated environmental liability of\napproximately $3.8 million and has not recorded any potential insurancerecoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup. The progress of future remediation efforts cannotbe predicted with\ncertainty and these costs may change. The Company believes that any amount in addition towhat has already been accrued would not be material.Other Legal MattersThe Company is a defendant or plaintiff\nin various actions that arose in the normal course of business. Withrespect to these matters, based on the management’s current knowledge, the Company believes that the amountor range of reasonably\npossible loss, if any, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a materialadverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.NOTE 18 - PendingAcquisitionOn October 26, 2020, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) withThrones Merger Sub, Inc., the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary (Merger Sub), and\nXilinx, Inc. (Xilinx),whereby Merger Sub will merge with and into Xilinx (the Merger), with Xilinx surviving such Merger as a whollyowned subsidiary of the Company. Under the Merger Agreement, at the\neffective time of the Merger (the EffectiveTime), each share of common stock of Xilinx (Xilinx Common Stock) issued and outstanding immediately prior tothe Effective Time (other than treasury shares\nand any shares of Xilinx Common Stock held directly by theCompany or Merger Sub) will be converted into the right to receive 1.7234 fully paid and non-assessable sharesof the Company’s common stockand, if applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares, subject to any applicablewithholding. As of the signing of the Merger Agreement, the transaction was valued at $35 billion. The actualvaluation\nof the transaction could differ significantly from the estimated amount due to movements in the price ofthe Company’s common stock, the number of shares of Xilinx common stock outstanding on the\nclosing date ofthe Merger and other factors.Under the Merger Agreement, the Company will be required to pay a termination fee to Xilinx equal to $1.5 billionif the Merger Agreement is terminated in\ncertain circumstances, including if the Merger Agreement is terminatedbecause the Company’s board of directors has changed its recommendation. The Company will be required topay a termination feeequal to $1.0 billion if the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances relatedto the failure to obtain required regulatory approvals prior to October 26, 2021 (subject to automatic\nextensionfirst to January 26, 2022 and then to April 26, 2022, in each case, to the extent the regulatory closing conditionsremain outstanding).On April 7, 2021, the Company’s stockholders voted to\napprove all the proposals relating to the Merger at aspecial meeting of stockholders. Xilinx stockholders also voted to approve their respective proposals relating tothe Merger at a Xilinx special\nmeeting held on the same day. The closing of the Merger is subject to customaryconditions, including regulatory approval.
