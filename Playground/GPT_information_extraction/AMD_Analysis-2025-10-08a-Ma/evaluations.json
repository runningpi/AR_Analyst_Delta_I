Diluted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.92 per share a year ago, primarily due to lower client\noperating income.Now turning to our reportable segment for the fourth quarter. Starting with the Data Center segment. Revenue was $1.7 billion, up 42% year-over-year,primarily driven by strong growth in third-generation EPYC server processor revenue and the early ramp of fourth-generation EPYC processors.Data center operating income was $444 million or 27% of revenue compared to $369 million or 32% a year ago. Higher operating income wasdriven primarily by stronger revenue, partially offset by higher R&D investment to support the top line revenue growth.Client segment revenue was $903 million, down 51% year-over-year due to reduced processor shipments resulting from a weak PC market andsignificant inventory correction across the PC supply chain. Client operating loss was $152 million compared to operating income of $530 million",

Second half, we should see the expansion\nof gross margin.Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD & AnalystSure. And as my follow-up on your PC Client business, so it had its correction a little bit later than some of the other folks in the semiindustry and was obviously a little bit steeper. Can you talk about why that happened and why we should or should not expect that?\nOr could that happen in the Data Center business as well?Lisa Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Chair of the BoardI guess Chris, what I would say is I think the PC market has been volatile, and we did significantly -- coming off the pandemic, therewas very high demand during the pandemic, and I think we were all adjusting as we're looking at sort of the demand environmentpost-pandemic and with macro uncertainty. I think the Data Center business, we have again, our -- we're heavily weighted towardscloud, and we have very good discussions with our overall customer set in terms of what they need. I think what's going in our favorin the Data Center is our workloads are expanding. And so we've heard from all of our cloud customers that they're adopting bothMilan and Genoa in more workloads than previous. And so I think that gives us good confidence.And frankly, the Data Center customers are also giving us good visibility into what they need for 2023. So there is an adjustment inthe first half. And I think that's something that we understand. And we also expect that we're going to have to ramp up productionin the second half as some of the demand resumes. And I think the overall factor of compute in the cloud being a very important",

Starting with the Data Center segment. Revenue was $1.7 billion, up 42% year-over-year,primarily driven by strong growth in third-generation EPYC server processor revenue and the early ramp of fourth-generation EPYC processors.Data center operating income was $444 million or 27% of revenue compared to $369 million or 32% a year ago. Higher operating income wasdriven primarily by stronger revenue, partially offset by higher R&D investment to support the top line revenue growth.Client segment revenue was $903 million, down 51% year-over-year due to reduced processor shipments resulting from a weak PC market andsignificant inventory correction across the PC supply chain. Client operating loss was $152 million compared to operating income of $530 milliona year ago or 29% of revenue, primarily due to lower revenue.Gaming segment revenue was $1.6 billion, down 7% year-over-year due to lower gaming graphics revenue, partially offset by higher semi-customerproduct sales. Gaming operating income was $266 million or 16% of revenue compared to $407 million or 23% a year ago. The decrease was\nprimarily due to lower graphics revenue.Embedded segment revenue was $1.4 billion, up $1.3 billion from a year ago, primarily due to the inclusion of Xilinx Embedded revenue.

During the quarter, we returned $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases. In 2022, we returned a total of $3.7\nbillion to shareholders which was 119% of free cash flow. We have $6.5 billion in remaining authorization to share repurchases. Free cash flow was\n$443 million compared to $736 million in the same quarter last year.\nFree cash flow decreased primarily due to higher inventory. Inventory was $3.8 billion, up approximately $402 million from the prior quarter,\nprimarily driven by the inventory increase in advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products.Now let me turn to our full year financial results. 2022 revenue was $23.6 billion, up 44% year-over-year, driven by increased Embedded, Data\nCenter and the Gaming segment revenue, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue.

The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by lower\ngaming graphics revenue and inventory, pricing and related reserves.\nGaming operating income was $687 million for the nine months ended September 24, 2022, compared to operating\nincome of $527 million for the prior year period. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher\nrevenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses.

Earnings per share was $3.50 compared to $2.79 for the prior\nyear, primarily due to Data Center growth and addition of Xilinx.\nFull year free cash flow was $3.1 billion, resulting free cash flow margin of 13% for the year.

And then, Lisa, as my follow-up, I had a question on profitability in your client business or your PC business. I\nthink a year ago, margins were really high. Supply was relatively tight. Since then, with the inventory correction and perhaps a little\nbit more competition, your profit margins are down. You talked about the first half of this year still being sort of in digestion mode,\nand then in the second half, things normalizing. But would it be realistic to assume your gross margins in the Client business return\nto first half '22 levels? Or in hindsight, margins back then were perhaps you were over-earning in that business given the environment?\nLisa Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Chair of the Board\nYes. Sure. So I think on the Client segment, it's fair to say that we believe, given where we are with the client inventory levels, the\nfirst half will certainly be lower. We expect some improvement in the second half. But in terms of overall margin, we expect that the\nclient business will be below the corporate average, and that's how we're modeling the client business.\nOperator\nNext question is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.\nAaron Christopher Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior\nEquity Analyst",

We have a strong balance sheet with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment of $5.9 billion at the end of\nthe fourth quarter. During the quarter, we returned $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases. In 2022, we returned a total of $3.7\nbillion to shareholders which was 119% of free cash flow. We have $6.5 billion in remaining authorization to share repurchases. Free cash flow was\n$443 million compared to $736 million in the same quarter last year.\nFree cash flow decreased primarily due to higher inventory. Inventory was $3.8 billion, up approximately $402 million from the prior quarter,\nprimarily driven by the inventory increase in advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products.Now let me turn to our full year financial results. 2022 revenue was $23.6 billion, up 44% year-over-year, driven by increased Embedded, Data\nCenter and the Gaming segment revenue, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. On our combined AMD and Xilinx company basis, 2022\npro forma revenue was $24.1 billion, up 20% compared to $20.1 billion in 2021. Gross margin was 52%, up 370 basis points from the prior year,\nprimarily driven by richer product mix with higher revenue from Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment\nrevenue.\nOperating expenses were 26% of revenue compared to 24% in 2021. 2022 operating income was $6.3 billion, up $2.3 billion, an increase of 56%\nfrom a year ago resulting in operating margin of 27% compared to 25% in 2021, primarily driven by higher revenue and gross margin expansion.\nNet income was $5.5 billion compared to $3.4 billion, up 60% from the prior year. Earnings per share was $3.50 compared to $2.79 for the prior\nyear, primarily due to Data Center growth and addition of Xilinx.\nFull year free cash flow was $3.1 billion, resulting free cash flow margin of 13% for the year. We invested approximately $1 billion in long-term\nsupply chain capacity in 2022 to support our expectations for future revenue growth and increase market share.",

We have a strong balance sheet with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment of $5.9 billion at the end of\nthe fourth quarter. During the quarter, we returned $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases. In 2022, we returned a total of $3.7\nbillion to shareholders which was 119% of free cash flow. We have $6.5 billion in remaining authorization to share repurchases. Free cash flow was\n$443 million compared to $736 million in the same quarter last year.\nFree cash flow decreased primarily due to higher inventory. Inventory was $3.8 billion, up approximately $402 million from the prior quarter,\nprimarily driven by the inventory increase in advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products.Now let me turn to our full year financial results. 2022 revenue was $23.6 billion, up 44% year-over-year, driven by increased Embedded, Data\nCenter and the Gaming segment revenue, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue.

A server is a computer system that performs services for connected customers as part of a client-serverarchitecture. Many servers are designed to run an application or applications\noften for extended periods of time with minimalhuman intervention. Examples of servers include cloud, web, e-mail, print and on-premise servers. These servers can run avariety of applications,including business intelligence, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management andadvanced scientific or engineering models to solve advanced computational problems in disciplines\nranging from financialmodeling to weather forecasting to oil and gas exploration. Servers are also used in cloud computing, which is a computingmodel where data, applications and services are\ndelivered over the internet or an intranet which can be rapidly provisionedand released with minimal effort. Today’s data centers require new technologies and configuration models to meet thedemand\ndriven by the growing amount of data that needs to be stored, accessed, analyzed and managed. Servers must beefficient, scalable and adaptable to meet the compute characteristics of new and changingworkloads.Embedded. Embedded products address computing needs in casino gaming machines as well as enterprise-classtelecommunications, networking, security, storage systems and thin clients (which are\ncomputers that serve as an accessdevice on a network), and in PC-adjacent markets, such as industrial control and automation, digital signage, point-of-sale/self-service kiosks, and medical imaging.\nTypically, AMD embedded products are used in applications that require high tomoderate levels of performance, where key features may include relatively low power, small form factor, and\n24x7operations. High-performance graphics are increasingly important in many embedded systems. Support for Linux ,Windows and other operating systems as well as for increasingly sophisticated\napplications are also critical for somecustomers. Other requirements may include meeting rigid specifications for industrial temperatures, shock, vibration andreliability. The embedded market hasmoved from developing proprietary, custom designs to leveraging industry-standardinstruction set architectures and processors as a way to help reduce costs and speed time to market.Semi-Custom.

Semi-custom SoC revenue grew year-over-year as demand for game consoles remained strong during the holidays. Gaming\ngraphics revenue declined year-over-year as we further reduced desktop GPU downstream channel inventory. Channel sell-through of our Radeon\nRX GPUs increased sequentially, and we launched our high-end Radeon 7900 series GPUs to strong demand based on the performance of our new\nRDNA 3 architecture and 5-nanometer chiplet design.\nIn January, we announced our first RDNA 3 mobile GPUs that have been selected to power new gaming notebooks from Dell, Alienware, ASUS and\nothers that are on track to begin shipping in the first half of 2023.",
