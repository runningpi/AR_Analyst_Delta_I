Adjustments to arrive at the GAAP financial outlook typically include stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, incometax provision, equity income in investee, and other non- recurring items such as loss on debt redemption/conversion, impairment charges and acquisition-related costs. The timing and impact of suchadjustments are dependent on future events that are typically uncertain or outside of AMD's control, therefore, a reconciliation to equivalent GAAP measures is not practicable at this time. 2.

We have a strong balance sheet with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment of $5.9 billion at the end of\\nthe fourth quarter. During the quarter, we returned $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases. In 2022, we returned a total of $3.7\\nbillion to shareholders which was 119% of free cash flow. We have $6.5 billion in remaining authorization to share repurchases. Free cash flow was\\n$443 million compared to $736 million in the same quarter last year.\\nFree cash flow decreased primarily due to higher inventory. Inventory was $3.8 billion, up approximately $402 million from the prior quarter,\\nprimarily driven by the inventory increase in advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products.Now let me turn to our full year financial results. 2022 revenue was $23.6 billion, up 44% year-over-year, driven by increased Embedded, Data\\nCenter and the Gaming segment revenue, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. On our combined AMD and Xilinx company basis, 2022\\npro forma revenue was $24.1 billion, up 20% compared to $20.1 billion in 2021. Gross margin was 52%, up 370 basis points from the prior year,\\nprimarily driven by richer product mix with higher revenue from Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment\\nrevenue.\\nOperating expenses were 26% of revenue compared to 24% in 2021. 2022 operating income was $6.3 billion, up $2.3 billion, an increase of 56%\\nfrom a year ago resulting in operating margin of 27% compared to 25% in 2021, primarily driven by higher revenue and gross margin expansion.\\nNet income was $5.5 billion compared to $3.4 billion, up 60% from the prior year. Earnings per share was $3.50 compared to $2.79 for the prior\\nyear, primarily due to Data Center growth and addition of Xilinx.\\nFull year free cash flow was $3.1 billion, resulting free cash flow margin of 13% for the year. We invested approximately $1 billion in long-term\\nsupply chain capacity in 2022 to support our expectations for future revenue growth and increase market share.\"}",

This document is about: the financial performance and operational updates of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022, including revenue growth, segment performance, and future outlook.\\n\\nNow let me turn to our full year financial results. 2022 revenue was $23.6 billion, up 44% year-over-year, driven by increased Embedded, Data\\nCenter and the Gaming segment revenue, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. On our combined AMD and Xilinx company basis, 2022\\npro forma revenue was $24.1 billion, up 20% compared to $20.1 billion in 2021. Gross margin was 52%, up 370 basis points from the prior year,\\nprimarily driven by richer product mix with higher revenue from Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment\\nrevenue.\\nOperating expenses were 26% of revenue compared to 24% in 2021. 2022 operating income was $6.3 billion, up $2.3 billion, an increase of 56%\\nfrom a year ago resulting in operating margin of 27% compared to 25% in 2021, primarily driven by higher revenue and gross margin expansion.\\nNet income was $5.5 billion compared to $3.4 billion, up 60% from the prior year. Earnings per share was $3.50 compared to $2.79 for the prior\\nyear, primarily due to Data Center growth and addition of Xilinx.\\nFull year free cash flow was $3.1 billion, resulting free cash flow margin of 13% for the year. We invested approximately $1 billion in long-term\\nsupply chain capacity in 2022 to support our expectations for future revenue growth and increase market share.\"}",

Combined with our open-source software, Radeon™ Open eCosystem\\n(ROCm), our customers can deliver adifferentiated acceleration platforms to address the next-generation of computing challenges while minimizing power andspace needs in the data center.In March 2019,\\nGoogle announced its new Stadia™ cloud gaming service using high-performance, custom AMDRadeon data center GPUs. In May 2019, the US Department of Energy announced the Frontier exascale A+A (AMD\\nCPUsplus AMD GPUs) system with Oakridge National Labs (ORNL). In August 2019, Microsoft announced its new NVv4-seriescloud offering of Azure Virtual Machines based on Radeon Instinct™ MI25 GPUs. And\\nin November 2019, we releasedROCm 3.0, marking a major milestone in the path to Exascale class systems and platforms.Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-CustomThe Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom\"}",
