    "PC demand will likely remain weak into early 2023, although we look for sequential recovery as the year progresses.",
    "AMD's cautious 1Q23 revenue growth and gross margin guidance forecast reflects the challenging environment.",
    "Gaming-related sales declined year over year, reflecting both inflationary pressure on discretionary purchases as well as long-in-the-tooth gaming consoles from the major OEMs.",
    "Embedded has become a $4.5 billion annual business for AMD, compared with $1.25 billion for 2021; that is mainly though not exclusively due to the Xilinx acquisition.",
    "Data Center grew 42% year-over-year in 4Q and 64% for the year.",
    "Now a $6 billion annual business, data center is driven by market share gains for AMD's EPYC server CPUs.",
    "As Intel's recent quarterly releases have made clear, AMD has gained meaningful global market share in CPUs for the data center and client space in the past several years.",
    "AMD delivered full-year 2022 revenue growth of 44%, on top of 68% growth in 2021 reflecting multi-year gains in market share.",
    "The early 2023 growth outlook is uncertain.",
    "But share gains in client and in data center, market leadership in console gaming, and the much enhanced embedded business position AMD for long-term growth exceeding those of the market and the peer group.",

    "She replaces Devinder Kumar, who is retiring.",
    "CFO. Hu has served in the CFO role (and at times as interim CEO) at QLogic, Conexant, and Marvell, along with other postings.",
    "She is well-respected in financial circles, and we believe she will benefit the already strong leadership team at AMD.",
    "Saeied Moshkelani is SVP and GM of Client Compute Group.",
    "We believe that the company's IP monetization strategy, as well as success in EE&SC, could give CEO Su a longer leash than was given to prior CEOs.",
    "The pandemic has turned around what had been structural decline in PCs, and AMD appears positioned for market share gains at the expense of Intel, which is wrestling with production issues.",
    "The acquisition of Xilinx for $35 billion carries multiple risks, including potential issues with cultural integration, a misreading of end-market outlooks, and potential end-market cannibalization.",
    "We believe these risks are worth the TAM opportunities afforded by XLNX.",
    "The all-stock nature of the deal also eliminates the potential for a cumbersome debt burden.",
    "The deal has diluted the share base, but AMD is acquiring growing and higher-margin assets that should not be dilutive to EPS.",
    "A main risk for AMD, as for other semiconductor companies, is the possibility of a general economic downturn and a corresponding dip in technology hardware sales due to inflation and rising interest rates.",
    "We believe that AMD has the financial strength, market leadership, and growth characteristics to weather this storm and emerge a stronger player.",
    "We also believe the percentage of hours worked away from the office will continue to increase.",
    "That should drive long-term demand for personal PCs served by AMD CPUs, for data center CPUs to manage fast-growing data traffic, and for GPUs for gaming applications.",
    "AMD has been betting heavily on nontraditional businesses, including embedded, micro-server, and semi-custom (gaming console).",
    "Simultaneously, AMD is supporting both stand-alone CPU and GPU lines as well as its APU line that combines compute and graphics processing on a single die."

    "The two-year-forward relative P/E of 1.05 is just above the market P/E and remains well below the historical average for 2018-2021 of 2.19.",
    "Historical comparable valuation for AMD indicates value in the low $200s, in a stable trend and well above current prices.",
    "Peer group analysis suggests that AMD deserves to trade at a premium to peers on absolute and relative P/E; our peer-indicated value is in the $90s, down from a late 2021 peak in the $160s due to the 2022 peer-group selloff.",
    "Our discounted free cash flow model renders a fair value in the $150s, down from past peaks on slowing PC momentum.",
    "Blending these approaches, we arrive at a value above $150, below past peaks but well above current prices.",
    "While the client market is likely to remain volatile in the near term, we are encouraged by the progress of EPYC in cloud and enterprise data center, the success of Ryzen CPUs for desktop and notebook PCs, and the outlook for AMD's Radeon GPUs in the PC gaming.",
    "We regard the XLNX deal as a logical next step in AMD's journey, one that adds high-growth complementary assets that will accelerate AMD's growth in the cloud data center and high-value-added nontechnology markets.",
    "Like many Technology stocks, AMD has slipped from its highs on consumer demand softness.",
    "Current prices in our view do not fully reflect AMD's revenue and margin growth potential, and ongoing market share gains at Intel's expense.",
    "We are reiterating our BUY rating to a 12-month target price of $100.",
    "On February 1 at midday, BUY-rated AMD traded at $80.48, up $5.33."
