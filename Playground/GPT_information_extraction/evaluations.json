This document is about: the financial performance and outlook of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022, including revenue, net income, and segment performance.  Fourth quarter 2022 revenue for $5.6 billion was up 16% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue in the Embedded and Data Center segment,partially offset by lower Client and the Gaming segment revenue. Gross margin was 51%, up 70 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven byricher product mix with higher revenue in Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. Operatingexpenses were $1.6 billion compared to $1.1 billion a year ago, driven by the inclusion of Xilinx OpEx and additional R&D and go-to-market investments to support the next phase of our revenue growth.Operating income declined $66 million from a year ago to $1.3 billion, and the operating margin was 23%, down from 27% a year ago. Net incomewas $1.1 billion flat year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.92 per share a year ago, primarily due to lower client operating income.Now turning to our reportable segment for the fourth quarter. Starting with the Data Center segment. Revenue was $1.7 billion, up 42% year-over-year,primarily driven by strong growth in third-generation EPYC server processor revenue and the early ramp of fourth-generation EPYC processors.Data center operating income was $444 million or 27% of revenue compared to $369 million or 32% a year ago. Higher operating income wasdriven primarily by stronger revenue, partially offset by higher R&D investment to support the top line revenue growth.Client segment revenue was $903 million, down 51% year-over-year due to reduced processor shipments resulting from a weak PC market andsignificant inventory correction across the PC supply chain. Client operating loss was $152 million compared to operating income of $530 million",

      "reason": "The KB clearly supports the 'PC weakness' (Client revenue down 51% due to weak PC market and inventory correction) and 'data center strength' (Data Center revenue up 42%, strong EPYC growth). However, the KB excerpts do not state an explicit 'caution ahead' (only actions like inventory reductions) and do not provide any evidence that AMD's 4Q22 non-GAAP results 'exceeded guidance and consensus estimates.'"
