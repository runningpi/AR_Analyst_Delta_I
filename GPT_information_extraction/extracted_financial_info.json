AMD advanced 57% in 2021,\nversus a 34% gain for peer group; rose 100% in 2020, while peers\nadvanced 49%; was up 148% in 2019, while peers were up 54%;\nand rose 80% in 2018, compared with a 4% decline for peers.\nAMD, which has been as high as $154 late in 2021, was a sub-$2\nstock in 2015.\n For 4Q22, Advanced Micro Devices reported revenue of $6.0\nbillion, which was up 16% year-over-year and 1% sequentially.\nRevenue included a full contribution from Xilinx. Revenue\nexceeded the high end of the guidance range of $5.2-$5.8 billion\nand was nearly half a billion dollars above the consensus estimate\nof $5.5 billion. Non-GAAP profit totaled $0.69 per diluted share,\ndown 25% from $0.92 a year earlier and up $0.01 sequentially.\nAMD management does not provide explicit EPS guidance. The\nStreet had projected non-GAAP EPS of $0.67.\n As of mid-year 2022, AMD had delivered a long string of\nrecord quarters, powering through the pandemic and the supply\nchain crisis while taking share in multiple end-markets. The\nacquisition of Xilinx appeared to position AMD to build on\nexisting strength and growing presence in data center markets.\n The emergence of inflation at 40-year highs has changed global\nconsumer spending patterns and has had a particularly intense\nimpact in the consumer electronics space. For many companies,\nconsumer weakness has spilled into the enterprise, carrier, and\ncloud data-center end markets. Fueled by the Xilinx acquisition\nand its own competitive share gains, AMD was able to offset some\nof the most intense weakness in the client space with strong\nproduct sales in data center and embedded processing.\n CEO Lisa Su began by thanking former CFO Devinder Kumar\nfor a remarkable 39 years at AMD, and welcoming incoming CFO\nJean Hu. Over the past 14 years, she has served in the CFO role\n(and at times as interim CEO) at QLogic, Conexant, and Marvell.\n",
