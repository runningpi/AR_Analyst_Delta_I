    "She\nis well-respected in financial circles, and we believe she will benefit\nthe already strong leadership team at AMD.",
    "Saeied Moshkelani is\nSVP and GM of Client Compute Group.",
    "We believe that the company's IP monetization strategy, as well\nas success in EE&SC, could give CEO Su a longer leash than was\ngiven to prior CEOs.",
    "The pandemic has turned around what had\nbeen structural decline in PCs, and AMD appears positioned for\nmarket share gains at the expense of Intel, which is wrestling with\nproduction issues.",
    "The acquisition of Xilinx for $35 billion carries multiple risks,\nincluding potential issues with cultural integration, a misreading of\nend-market outlooks, and potential end-market cannibalization.",
    "We believe these risks are worth the TAM opportunities afforded\nby XLNX.",
    "The all-stock nature of the deal also eliminates the\npotential for a cumbersome debt burden.",
    "The deal has diluted the\nshare base, but AMD is acquiring growing and higher-margin\nassets that should not be dilutive to EPS.",
    "A main risk for AMD, as for other semiconductor companies, is\nthe possibility of a general economic downturn and a\ncorresponding dip in technology hardware sales due to inflation\nand rising interest rates.",
    "We believe that AMD has the financial\nstrength, market leadership, and growth characteristics to weather\nthis storm and emerge a stronger player.",
    "We also believe the\npercentage of hours worked away from the office will continue to\nincrease.",
    "That should drive long-term demand for personal PCs\nserved by AMD CPUs, for data center CPUs to manage\nfast-growing data traffic, and for GPUs for gaming applications.",
    "AMD has been betting heavily on nontraditional businesses,\nincluding embedded, micro-server, and semi-custom (gaming\nconsole).",
