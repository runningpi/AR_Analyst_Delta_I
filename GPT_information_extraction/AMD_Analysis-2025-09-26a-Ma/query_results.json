Fourth quarter 2022 revenue for $5.6 billion was up 16% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue in the Embedded and Data Center segment,partially offset by lower Client and the Gaming segment revenue.

Turning to the fourth quarter business results, starting with our Data Center segment. Revenue increased 42% year-over-year to $1.7 billion, ledby increased adoption of our EPYC processors by cloud providers. In cloud, sales to North American hyperscalers more than doubled year-over-yearas hyperscale customers continued moving more of their internal workloads and external instances to EPYC processors. EPYC processors nowpower more than 600 publicly available instances globally following the launches of new AMD-based instances from AWS, Microsoft and others in the quarter.In Enterprise, revenue declined year-over-year as demand slowed based on the macro environment. Against this backdrop, we continue expandingour pipeline and closed a number of new wins in the fourth quarter with Fortune 500 financial services, automotive, technology, energy andaerospace companies. In HPC, growing EPYC processor adoption was highlighted by the number of AMD-powered supercomputers on the latesttop 500 list increasing by 38% year-over-year. AMD now powers more than 100 of the world's fastest supercomputers and 15 of the top 20 most energy-efficient supercomputers in the world.To build our Data Center leadership, we launched our fourth gen EPYC processors this past November that deliver up to 2x faster performance incloud, enterprise and HPC applications, and are up to 80% more energy efficient than the competition's most recently announced offerings. Weare seeing very strong customer pull for fourth-gen EPYC CPUs, which complement our third-gen offerings with additional performance and capabilities.Initial cloud deployments are going very well, and we expect to ramp both internal workloads and public instances throughout 2023.For Enterprise, there are more than 140 fourth-gen EPYC platforms in development from HPE, Dell, Lenovo, Supermicro and others, an increase of 40% compared to the prior generation.Now looking at our broader Data Center portfolio. We had record sales of our Xilinx Data Center and networking products in the quarter, led by\"}",
