      " → Reason: The KB confirms a non-GAAP gross margin for Q4 2022 around 51% and attributes margin gains to a richer mix (higher Embedded/Data Center, lower Client/consumer-PC revenue). This aligns with the snippet’s assertion of margin improvement due to mix. However, the exact figures cited (51.1% for 4Q22, 49.9% for 3Q22, 50.3% a year earlier) are not consistently documented in the KB (the KB lists 51% or 52% for Q4/FY and does not provide a 3Q22 margin), so the numeric specifics are not fully supported.
